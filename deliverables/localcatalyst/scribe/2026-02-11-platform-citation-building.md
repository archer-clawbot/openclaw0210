## Your Business Listed. Everywhere That Matters.

Citations are mentions of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) across the web — directories, data aggregators, social platforms, and industry-specific listings. They are a confirmed local ranking factor, and inconsistent or missing citations are one of the most common reasons local businesses underperform in search.

The problem is not that citation building is complicated. The problem is that it is tedious, time-consuming, and easy to do wrong. Automated submission tools blast your information to hundreds of low-quality directories. Agencies charge monthly retainers for work that should be done once and done right.

LocalCatalyst does it differently. Manual submissions to directories that matter. A NAP consistency audit before any submissions begin. A confirmation report with live links when the work is complete.

No subscriptions. No automated blasts. No recurring fees for work that is already finished.

## Pricing

### Essential — $197
**25 Directories | 5-7 Business Days**

The core directories that carry the most weight for local SEO: Google Business Profile verification, Yelp, Facebook, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Foursquare, Yellow Pages, BBB, and the top data aggregators that feed hundreds of smaller directories downstream.

Best for businesses that need a clean foundation of authoritative citations.

### Professional — $347
**50 Directories | 5-7 Business Days**

Everything in Essential, plus an expanded set of general and regional directories: Angi, Thumbtack, MapQuest, Citysearch, Superpages, Manta, Hotfrog, and dozens more. Broader coverage means stronger local signals and more opportunities for customers to find consistent information about your business.

Best for businesses in competitive local markets where citation volume is a differentiator.

### Premium — $597
**100+ Directories Including Niche | 5-7 Business Days**

Everything in Professional, plus niche and industry-specific directory submissions. A plumber gets listed on plumbing-specific directories. A dentist gets listed on healthcare directories. A restaurant gets listed on food and hospitality platforms.

Niche citations carry significantly more weight than general directories because they signal industry relevance to search engines.

Best for businesses that want comprehensive citation coverage with no gaps for competitors to exploit.

## Why Citations Still Matter in 2026

Every year, someone publishes an article claiming citations are dead. Every year, the data says otherwise.

Citations serve three functions that directly affect your local rankings:

**1. NAP Consistency Signals**
Google cross-references your business information across the web. When your name, address, and phone number are consistent everywhere, it reinforces trust in your listing. When the information is inconsistent — old phone numbers, wrong addresses, misspelled business names — it creates uncertainty that suppresses your rankings.

**2. Discovery and Indexation**
Directory listings create additional indexed pages that reference your business. Each one is an opportunity for a customer to find you through a different search path. When someone searches for "plumber near me" on Yelp, or browses Angi for HVAC contractors, your listing needs to be there.

**3. Local Authority Signals**
The quantity and quality of structured citations contribute to your overall local authority. Businesses with strong, consistent citation profiles consistently outrank businesses with thin or inconsistent profiles — all else being equal.

Citations are not the only ranking factor. But they are one you can control completely, and neglecting them gives competitors an easy advantage.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How are your submissions different from automated tools like Yext or Moz Local?**
Automated tools create listings that disappear when you stop paying. Our submissions are manual — each listing is individually created and exists permanently. You own them. No ongoing subscription required.

**What if I already have citations with incorrect information?**
The NAP consistency audit included with every tier identifies existing inconsistencies. If you need corrections made to existing listings, we can handle that as part of the submission process.

**Do you guarantee all listings will go live?**
We submit to every directory in your selected tier. Most go live within 5-7 business days. Some directories have longer verification processes. Your confirmation report shows the status of every submission, and we follow up on any that are pending.

**Can I choose which directories you submit to?**
Each tier includes our recommended directory list, selected based on domain authority, local relevance, and data aggregator relationships. If you have specific directories you want included, note them in the intake form and we will accommodate them.

**Do I need citation building if I already have a Google Business Profile?**
Yes. GBP is one citation. Your local ranking is influenced by the consistency and breadth of your entire citation profile across the web. GBP alone is not enough.
