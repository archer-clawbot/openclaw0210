At LocalCatalyst.ai, we believe local businesses deserve the same caliber of SEO expertise that Fortune 500 companies take for granted. Our team combines deep technical knowledge, years of hands-on local search experience, and a genuine passion for helping businesses become the go-to choice in their communities.

Every member of our team specializes in local SEO. We don't dabble in national campaigns, e-commerce optimization, or social media management. Local search is all we do --- and that singular focus is what makes us different.

## Cody Hinton — Founder & CEO

**Credentials:** Google Partner, CATALYST Methodology Architect

Cody founded LocalCatalyst after spending a decade in digital marketing watching local businesses get shortchanged by agencies that treated them as afterthoughts. He saw enterprise-level SEO strategies that delivered massive ROI for national brands --- and realized that with the right systems, those same strategies could be adapted for local businesses at a fraction of the cost.

That realization became the CATALYST Methodology: a structured, repeatable framework that brings audit-driven, data-backed SEO to businesses competing in local markets. Cody oversees company strategy, client success, and the continued development of LocalCatalyst's proprietary AI-powered workflows.

Before founding LocalCatalyst, Cody helped scale a regional marketing agency from 12 to 85 clients, with a focus on service-area businesses and multi-location brands. He has spoken at local marketing conferences across the Southwest and contributes regularly to industry publications on the intersection of AI and local search.

**Fun fact:** Cody is a competitive disc golfer and has visited over 200 courses across 18 states. He says reading a disc golf course and reading a local search landscape require the same skill --- understanding terrain, wind patterns, and where everyone else is throwing.

Sarah brings over eight years of dedicated local SEO experience to LocalCatalyst, where she leads the development and refinement of our CATALYST methodology. Before joining the team, she spent five years at a top-20 digital agency managing local search campaigns for multi-location brands across healthcare, home services, and professional services.

At LocalCatalyst, Sarah designs the strategic roadmap for every client engagement. She translates audit findings into prioritized action plans, sets benchmarks using geo-grid rankings and Share of Local Voice (SoLV) metrics, and ensures every campaign is built on data rather than assumptions. Her work on competitive displacement modeling has become a core differentiator in how LocalCatalyst approaches saturated local markets.

Sarah is a firm believer that local SEO is not a set-it-and-forget-it service. She leads bi-weekly strategy reviews for every active client and personally oversees campaign pivots when algorithm updates shift the landscape.

**Fun fact:** Sarah is a home baker who documents her sourdough experiments with the same rigor she applies to keyword tracking spreadsheets. Her team Slack channel has a dedicated #sourdough thread with over 400 messages.

Marcus is a former full-stack web developer who pivoted into technical SEO after realizing that most ranking problems he encountered weren't content problems --- they were engineering problems. Slow load times, broken internal linking, missing structured data, and bloated code were silently killing visibility for businesses that had done everything else right.

At LocalCatalyst, Marcus leads every technical audit and oversees the implementation of technical fixes across client sites. He specializes in Core Web Vitals optimization, having brought dozens of client sites from "poor" to "good" CWV scores. His schema markup implementations --- including LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, and Review schemas --- have directly contributed to rich result appearances for clients across all 15 verticals.

Marcus is also the architect behind LocalCatalyst's site speed optimization process, which has achieved an average Largest Contentful Paint improvement of 58% across client sites. He works primarily with WordPress but has deep experience with Wix, Squarespace, and custom-built platforms.

**Fun fact:** Marcus builds custom mechanical keyboards in his spare time. He says debugging a CSS rendering issue and troubleshooting a keyboard PCB require the same patience and the same multimeter.

Jessica's background in journalism gives her something rare in the SEO world: the ability to write content that is genuinely useful to readers while simultaneously satisfying every signal Google looks for. She spent four years as a features writer for a metro daily newspaper before transitioning into content marketing, where she discovered that the same storytelling instincts that made good journalism also made great SEO content.

At LocalCatalyst, Jessica leads content strategy and production for all client campaigns. She designs topical authority maps, writes and edits service pages built for conversion, develops blog calendars that target long-tail and question-based queries, and ensures every piece of content meets E-E-A-T standards. Her service page framework --- which combines expert-level depth with clear calls to action --- has become a template used across all LocalCatalyst engagements.

Jessica also manages LocalCatalyst's AI-assisted content workflows, using AI tools to accelerate research and first-draft production while maintaining rigorous human editorial oversight on every published piece.

**Fun fact:** Jessica volunteers as a writing mentor at a local high school and keeps a running list of "words the internet has ruined." Currently at 47 entries. "Optimize" is on it.

## David Kim — GBP & Local Visibility Specialist

**Title:** GBP & Local Visibility Specialist
**Credentials:** Google Business Profile Gold Product Expert, BrightLocal Certified
**Specialties:** Google Business Profile optimization, review generation strategy, local pack ranking, citation management

David has spent more than five years focused exclusively on Google Business Profile optimization --- and that narrow focus has made him one of the most knowledgeable GBP practitioners in the industry. He manages GBP strategy across all 15 of LocalCatalyst's service verticals, and his playbooks for review generation, category optimization, and GBP post scheduling have been refined through hundreds of client engagements.

David's approach to GBP management goes far beyond filling out profile fields. He uses geo-grid ranking data to identify hyperlocal opportunities, monitors competitor GBP activity weekly, develops review response frameworks that reinforce E-E-A-T signals, and builds GBP post calendars that align with seasonal search demand. His citation audit process has corrected NAP inconsistencies for clients across more than 80 directory platforms.

At LocalCatalyst, David also leads the local visibility measurement practice, tracking Share of Local Voice (SoLV) and Weighted Visibility Score (WVS) metrics that give clients a far more accurate picture of their local search presence than generic position tracking ever could.

**Fun fact:** David is a dedicated home cook who treats restaurant discovery the same way he treats GBP optimization --- by exhaustively reading every review, studying the photos, and checking the competition within a two-mile radius before committing to a reservation.
