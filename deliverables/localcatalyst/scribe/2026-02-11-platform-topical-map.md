## The Problem: Most Businesses Guess at Content

You publish a blog post because someone said you should. You create a service page because a competitor has one. You build location pages because a YouTube video told you to.

But you never step back and ask: what does my site actually need to rank?

Most businesses guess at content. That's why most businesses don't rank.

A topical map eliminates the guessing. It's a complete blueprint of every page your website needs, organized by topic clusters, mapped to specific keywords, and ordered by implementation priority.

When you have one, you stop publishing random content and start building a site that Google recognizes as a topical authority in your space.

## What You Get

Your topical map is a structured document that lays out your entire content strategy. Here's what a sample map looks like for a plumbing company in Dallas:

**Hub page:** Plumbing Services Dallas
- **Spoke:** Emergency Plumber Dallas (1,300 searches/mo, KD 34)
- **Spoke:** Drain Cleaning Dallas (880 searches/mo, KD 28)
- **Spoke:** Water Heater Repair Dallas (720 searches/mo, KD 31)
- **Spoke:** Slab Leak Detection Dallas (390 searches/mo, KD 22)
- **Spoke:** Tankless Water Heater Installation Dallas (260 searches/mo, KD 19)

**Hub page:** Plumbing Tips Blog
- **Spoke:** How to Unclog a Drain Without Chemicals (2,400 searches/mo, KD 41)
- **Spoke:** Signs You Need to Replace Your Water Heater (1,100 searches/mo, KD 29)
- **Spoke:** What to Do During a Pipe Burst (890 searches/mo, KD 25)

That's two clusters out of what's typically 8-15 clusters per map. Each cluster builds topical authority in a specific area, and the internal linking between hubs and spokes signals to Google that your site comprehensively covers the topic.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Enter Your Domain
Tell us your website URL, your business type, your primary service area, and up to 10 target keywords (optional -- we'll find them if you don't have them).

### Step 2: AI Analyzes Your Market
Our system crawls your existing site, analyzes your competitors, researches keyword opportunities in your market, and identifies content gaps. It cross-references search volume, keyword difficulty, business relevance, and competitive landscape to determine what pages will have the most impact.

### Step 3: Download Your Map
Within 4-6 hours, you'll receive your complete topical map as both a downloadable CSV (for sorting and filtering) and a visual PDF (for presentations and planning).

## What's Included

Every topical map includes:

- **Complete site architecture** -- Every page your site needs, with recommended URL slugs
- **Keyword assignments** -- Primary and secondary keywords for each page with monthly search volume and difficulty scores
- **Content type designation** -- Service page, location page, blog post, hub page, or resource page
- **Hub-and-spoke mapping** -- Internal linking structure showing how pages connect to build topical authority
- **Priority implementation order** -- Pages ranked by impact so you know what to build first
- **Competitor gap analysis** -- Pages your competitors rank for that you're missing
- **Deliverable formats** -- Downloadable CSV + visual PDF

Typical output: 30-80 pages mapped across 8-15 topic clusters, depending on your industry and service area.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How accurate are the keyword metrics?**
Search volume and difficulty data come from the same sources agencies use (aggregated from Semrush, Ahrefs, and Google Keyword Planner data). We cross-reference multiple sources to give you the most reliable numbers available.

**What if I already have a lot of content?**
The system analyzes your existing pages and factors them into the map. You'll see which existing pages need optimization, which new pages to create, and how everything should link together. The map adapts to where you are, not just where you should be.

**Can I use this for multiple locations?**
The base price covers one primary service area. If you operate in multiple cities or regions, we can map each location's content needs. Contact us for multi-location pricing.

**Do I have to buy content pages from you?**
No. The topical map is a standalone deliverable. You can hand it to your in-house team, a freelancer, or any other content provider. Of course, if you want us to write the pages, we can do that too.

**What industries does this work for?**
Any local business. We have extra training data for dental, HVAC, plumbing, roofing, medical, legal, restaurant, and 20+ other verticals, but the methodology works for any service-based or location-based business.
