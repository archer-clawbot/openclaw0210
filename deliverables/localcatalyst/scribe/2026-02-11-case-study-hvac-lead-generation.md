## The Challenge

Catalyst Comfort HVAC is a mid-size heating, ventilation, and air conditioning company serving the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex. With 12 technicians and a strong reputation built over 15 years in the market, they had no shortage of expertise or service quality. What they lacked was visibility.

When Catalyst Comfort came to LocalCatalyst, they were spending $4,000 per month on Google Ads and generating only 8 organic leads per month. Their paid campaigns were delivering leads at $95 per acquisition, but organic search --- which should have been their most profitable channel --- was barely producing.

The competitive landscape in DFW HVAC is brutal. National franchises, private equity-backed home service platforms, and aggressive local competitors had locked up the Map Pack and top organic positions for every high-value keyword. Catalyst Comfort was invisible for terms like "AC repair Fort Worth," "HVAC company Dallas," and "furnace installation DFW."

### The Audit Revealed Four Critical Problems

Our CATALYST audit identified the root causes of their organic underperformance:

1. **Slow website performance:** The site had a Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) of 3.8 seconds --- well into Google's "poor" threshold. A bloated WordPress theme, unoptimized images, and render-blocking scripts were dragging load times down on every page.

2. **Thin service pages:** Catalyst Comfort had service pages, but they were 200-300 words each with generic descriptions that could have applied to any HVAC company in any city. No geographic targeting, no E-E-A-T signals, no structured data, and no conversion-focused design.

3. **Weak review profile:** 28 reviews with a 4.1-star average. In a market where top competitors had 200+ reviews at 4.7+ stars, this was a significant competitive disadvantage in both Map Pack ranking and consumer trust.

4. **Citation inconsistencies:** A citation audit revealed 52 inconsistencies across online directories --- including two old addresses from previous office locations, a decommissioned phone number still listed on 11 platforms, and three different variations of the business name.

## The Strategy

Based on the audit findings, we built a four-month CATALYST roadmap that prioritized fixes by effort-to-impact ratio.

### Month 1: Technical Foundation & GBP Overhaul

**Technical SEO:**
- Migrated to a lightweight WordPress theme optimized for Core Web Vitals
- Compressed and converted all images to WebP format with lazy loading
- Eliminated render-blocking JavaScript and deferred non-critical CSS
- Implemented server-side caching and CDN configuration
- **Result: LCP improved from 3.8 seconds to 1.9 seconds** --- moving from "poor" to "good" in Google's assessment

**Google Business Profile:**
- Complete GBP audit and optimization: updated categories, attributes, service areas, and business description
- Added 45 high-quality photos (service vehicles, team members, completed installations, office)
- Established weekly GBP post schedule aligned with seasonal HVAC demand
- Set up Q&A section with pre-seeded common questions and detailed answers

**Citation Cleanup:**
- Identified and documented all 52 citation inconsistencies across 38 directories
- Submitted corrections to major aggregators (Neustar Localeze, Data Axle, Foursquare)
- Manually updated high-authority directories (Yelp, BBB, Angi, HomeAdvisor, Yellow Pages)
- Claimed and corrected unclaimed listings, suppressed duplicates

### Month 2: Content Authority & Review Generation

**Service Page Overhaul:**
- Rewrote 8 core service pages to pillar-page depth (1,200-1,800 words each)
- Each page included: detailed service descriptions, the Catalyst Comfort process, pricing transparency, geographic targeting for DFW sub-markets, FAQ sections, and clear CTAs
- Implemented Service, FAQ, and LocalBusiness schema markup on every page
- Internal linking architecture redesigned to support topical clusters

**Content Strategy:**
- Published 4 seasonal content pieces targeting long-tail and question-based queries:
  - "How Much Does AC Repair Cost in Dallas-Fort Worth? (2026 Price Guide)"
  - "5 Signs Your Furnace Needs Replacement Before Next Winter"
  - "Central vs. Ductless AC: Which Is Right for Your DFW Home?"
  - "How to Choose an HVAC Company in Fort Worth: A Homeowner's Guide"

**Review Generation:**
- Implemented automated post-service review request workflow via SMS and email
- Created review response templates for the business owner
- **Reviews grew from 28 to 52, and average rating improved from 4.1 to 4.6 stars**

**Link Building:**
- Secured 6 locally relevant backlinks through:
  - DFW-area home improvement blog guest post
  - Local Chamber of Commerce membership and listing
  - Sponsorship of a community youth sports league (with website link)
  - Partnership listing on a local real estate agent's preferred vendor page
  - Inclusion in a "Best HVAC Companies in Fort Worth" roundup article
  - Local business association directory

### Month 3: Ranking Momentum

By the end of month 3, the compounding effect of technical fixes, content authority, citation consistency, and review growth began showing in rankings:

- **31 keywords ranking in the top 10** (up from 9 at baseline)
- **Map Pack visibility for 12 high-value terms** including "AC repair Fort Worth," "HVAC company near me" (DFW geo), and "furnace installation Dallas"
- Organic traffic to service pages increased 145% month-over-month
- GBP impressions increased 210% compared to the pre-engagement baseline
- Click-to-call actions from GBP increased from an average of 11/month to 34/month

### Month 4: Revenue Impact

The fourth month delivered the business outcomes that matter:

- **47 organic leads per month** (up from 8 at baseline --- a 488% increase)
- Organic lead quality was higher than PPC leads, with a 34% close rate vs. 22% for paid
- Catalyst Comfort **reduced PPC spend by 50%** ($4,000/month to $2,000/month) while increasing total lead volume
- Estimated monthly revenue from organic leads: $28,200 (based on average ticket size)
- **Campaign ROI: 340%** based on LocalCatalyst's monthly fee vs. attributed organic revenue

## Client Testimonial

> "I was skeptical when LocalCatalyst told me they could reduce my ad spend and increase my leads at the same time. That sounded like every other agency pitch I'd heard. The difference was they showed me exactly what was wrong, exactly what they were going to do about it, and exactly how they'd measure success. Four months later, the numbers speak for themselves. We're getting almost six times the organic leads we were before, and we cut our Google Ads budget in half. I wish I'd found them two years ago."

## Key Takeaways

1. **Technical SEO is not optional for local businesses.** A 3.8-second LCP was silently killing Catalyst Comfort's ability to rank. Most local SEO agencies would never have caught this.

2. **Thin content is a ranking ceiling.** 200-word service pages cannot compete against 1,500-word pillar pages with schema markup and geographic targeting. Content depth matters.

3. **Citation consistency is foundational.** 52 inconsistencies were sending conflicting signals to Google about where Catalyst Comfort was located and how to contact them. Cleaning this up unlocked ranking improvements across the board.

4. **Review velocity and quality compound.** Moving from 28 to 52 reviews with a rating improvement shifted both Map Pack ranking signals and consumer trust.

5. **Organic and paid should work together, not compete.** As organic visibility grew, Catalyst Comfort was able to reduce paid spend strategically without losing total lead volume.
