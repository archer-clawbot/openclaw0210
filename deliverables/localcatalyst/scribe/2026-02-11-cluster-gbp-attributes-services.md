## GBP Attributes and Services: The Hidden Fields That Expand Your Search Visibility

Most businesses treat their Google Business Profile as a digital business card — name, address, phone, hours. They fill in the basics and move on. What they miss are the dozens of additional fields Google provides to describe your business in granular detail: attributes, services, and products. These fields directly influence which searches trigger your listing and what information appears to potential customers. Our [Google Business Profile management services](/google-business-profile-management/) include complete optimization of every available field because each one is a signal Google uses to match your business to searcher intent.

A fully optimized attributes and services profile tells Google significantly more about your business than a bare-minimum profile. When someone searches for "wheelchair-accessible dentist near me" or "plumber that accepts credit cards," Google uses attribute data to filter results. If you offer those features but have not declared them in your GBP, you are invisible for those searches. Your competitors who have filled in their attributes are capturing that traffic instead.

## What GBP Attributes Are

Attributes are predefined descriptors that characterize your business beyond the basic category. Google offers two types of attributes, and understanding the distinction is important for optimization.

### Factual Attributes

Factual attributes are objective business features that you set directly in your GBP dashboard. These are binary declarations — your business either has the feature or it does not.

Common factual attributes include:

- **Accessibility** — Wheelchair-accessible entrance, wheelchair-accessible restroom, wheelchair-accessible seating
- **Amenities** — Free Wi-Fi, restrooms, outdoor seating, parking (free, paid, or street)
- **Payments** — Accepts credit cards, accepts debit cards, accepts NFC/contactless, accepts checks, cash only
- **Planning** — Appointments required, appointments recommended, walk-ins welcome
- **Service options** — Dine-in, takeout, delivery, curbside pickup, drive-through, online appointments, onsite services
- **Health and safety** — Staff wear masks, temperature checks required, sanitization practices
- **Crowd** — LGBTQ+-friendly, transgender-safe space, family-friendly
- **Ownership** — Veteran-owned, women-owned, Black-owned, Latino-owned

You control factual attributes. If your business offers free Wi-Fi and wheelchair accessibility, set those attributes and Google will display them on your listing and use them for search matching.

### Subjective Attributes

Subjective attributes are crowd-sourced from Google users and customer reviews. Google asks users questions like "Is this place good for kids?" or "Is this restaurant casual or upscale?" and aggregates the responses to assign subjective attributes.

You cannot directly set subjective attributes, but you can influence them:

- Encourage customers to answer Google's "Know this place?" questions
- Include relevant descriptors in your [GBP posts](/google-business-profile-management/gbp-posts/) and business description
- Feature related content in [photos and videos](/google-business-profile-management/gbp-photos-videos/) that signal the attribute (e.g., photos of family-friendly environments)
- Respond to reviews in ways that reinforce desired attributes

### How Attributes Impact Search Visibility

Attributes function as search filters. Google uses them to narrow results for qualified searches:

- "24-hour pharmacy near me" — matches businesses with the "Open 24 hours" attribute
- "restaurants with outdoor seating" — matches businesses with the "Outdoor seating" attribute
- "women-owned bakery" — matches businesses with the "Women-owned" attribute
- "dentist that takes walk-ins" — matches businesses with the "Walk-ins welcome" attribute

Every attribute you fail to set is a category of search you fail to appear in. The compounding effect is significant — a business with 20 correctly set attributes is eligible for dozens more search variations than a business with 3.

## Complete Attribute Optimization by Industry

Different industries have different available attributes. Google customizes the attribute options based on your primary category. Here is what to focus on:

**Medical and dental practices:** Insurance accepted, appointment required, telehealth available, accessibility features, languages spoken, parking, payment methods

**Restaurants and food service:** Dine-in/takeout/delivery options, dietary accommodations (vegetarian, vegan, halal, kosher), alcohol served, outdoor seating, reservations, price range, live music, catering

**Home services:** Emergency service available, onsite estimate, service area definition, licensed/insured indicators, payment methods, online booking

**Retail:** In-store shopping, curbside pickup, delivery, price range, payment methods, accessibility, parking

**Professional services:** Online appointments, consultations, languages spoken, payment methods, parking, accessibility

We audit the complete attribute list for your specific GBP category and ensure every applicable attribute is set. For multi-location businesses, attributes are configured per location since amenities and features may vary between locations.

## The Services Section

The services section allows you to list individual services your business provides, organized by category. Unlike attributes (which are predefined), services are free-form — you define the service names and descriptions.

### Setting Up Services

Services are organized in a two-tier hierarchy:

1. **Service categories** — Broad groupings (e.g., "Emergency Plumbing," "Drain Services," "Water Heater Services")
2. **Individual services** — Specific offerings within each category (e.g., "Burst Pipe Repair," "Sewer Line Camera Inspection," "Tankless Water Heater Installation")

Each individual service can include:

- **Service name** — Concise, keyword-relevant naming
- **Description** — Up to 300 characters describing the service
- **Price** — Fixed price or price range (optional but recommended where applicable)

### Best Practices for Service Descriptions

Service descriptions are a keyword opportunity that most businesses waste with generic copy or leave blank entirely.

**Weak:** "We fix pipes."
**Strong:** "Professional burst pipe repair with same-day emergency response. We locate the damage, repair or replace the affected section, and test the entire system. Licensed and insured. Serving the greater Austin metro area."

Each description should:

- Include the service keyword naturally
- Mention the geographic area served
- Highlight differentiators (speed, licensing, warranty, process)
- Include specific details that inform the customer's decision
- Stay within the 300-character limit while maximizing information density

### How Services Appear in Search

Google displays service information in multiple contexts:

- Directly on your GBP listing under the "Services" tab
- In Knowledge Panel search results when users search for your business by name
- As matching signals when users search for specific services — a listing with "tankless water heater installation" in its services section has a relevance advantage for that query

## The Products Section

For retail businesses, restaurants, and some service businesses, Google offers a products section where you can showcase specific products with photos, descriptions, and pricing.

Products appear as a visual carousel on your GBP listing, creating an engaging, shoppable experience directly in search results. Each product entry supports:

- Product name
- Product category
- Price or price range
- Description
- Photo
- Link to product page on your website

Restaurants can use the products section for menu items. Retail stores can feature bestsellers or seasonal inventory. Service businesses can showcase packaged offerings or product lines they carry (e.g., an HVAC company featuring specific equipment brands they install).

## Common Optimization Mistakes

- **Leaving attributes at defaults** — Many businesses never open the attributes section, leaving dozens of relevant attributes unset
- **Ignoring the services section entirely** — Google cannot match your business to service-specific queries if you have not listed your services
- **Generic service names** — Using internal jargon instead of customer-facing, keyword-rich service names
- **Blank descriptions** — Adding service names without descriptions wastes the keyword and informational opportunity
- **Inconsistent across locations** — [Multi-location businesses](/local-seo-services/multi-location-seo/) that copy the same services and attributes to every location regardless of what each location actually offers
- **Not updating seasonally** — Failing to add seasonal services or update product offerings as inventory changes

## FAQ

### How often should I update my GBP attributes and services?

Review attributes quarterly and after any business change (new payment methods, accessibility improvements, service additions). Services should be updated whenever you add or discontinue a service offering. Products sections need monthly attention for retail businesses with changing inventory.

### Do attributes directly affect my ranking?

Attributes serve primarily as qualifying filters rather than direct ranking boosters. They determine whether your listing is eligible to appear for filtered searches. A business without the "wheelchair accessible" attribute will not appear for wheelchair-accessible searches, regardless of how well-optimized the rest of the profile is. Setting all applicable attributes expands your total addressable search visibility.

### How many services should I list?

List every legitimate service your business offers. There is no penalty for a comprehensive services list, and each service expands your keyword footprint. However, each service should be a genuine offering — do not list services you do not actually provide. For most local businesses, 15-40 individual services across 3-8 categories is a thorough representation.
