# From Order to Delivery: How the CATALYST System Works

**You place an order. AI agents do the work. You get the deliverable. Here is what happens in between.**

Every product on this platform -- whether it is a [topical map](/services/topical-map/), an [SEO audit](/services/seo-audit/), a [content page](/services/content-pages/), or a [schema package](/services/schema-markup/) -- follows the same execution pipeline. The system is called CATALYST, and understanding how it works is the best way to understand why LocalCatalyst delivers faster, more consistently, and at lower cost than the alternatives.

---

## Step 1: Order Received

You select a product, enter your details -- domain, target keywords, business name, service area, any specific requirements -- and submit the order. This takes about five minutes.

The moment your order is confirmed, it enters the CATALYST dispatch system. There is no queue. There is no project manager assigning tasks during Monday's standup. The system reads your order parameters and routes the work to the appropriate agents immediately.

---

## Step 2: Task Dispatched

Different products activate different agents. Here is what a few common orders look like behind the scenes:

**Topical Map ($397):** The order is dispatched to **Scout**, our research agent, which crawls your site and your competitors to map the keyword landscape. The findings are then passed to **Silas**, our strategy agent, which organizes everything into a prioritized content architecture.

**SEO Audit ($297/$497):** **Scout** crawls your site and collects technical, on-page, and competitive data. **Silas** analyzes the data against 200+ ranking factors, scores each finding, and produces a prioritized audit report with specific action items.

**Content Pages ($69-97/page):** **Scribe**, our content agent, receives the target keyword, page type, and business context. It researches the keyword, analyzes top-ranking competitors, builds the content structure, and writes the full page with headers, meta tags, internal links, and FAQ sections.

**Schema Markup ($197/$397):** **Wrench**, our technical agent, analyzes your site structure and generates JSON-LD schema -- LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, Review, BreadcrumbList -- tailored to your pages and business data.

**GBP Optimization ($297/$497):** **Herald**, our GBP specialist agent, audits your current Google Business Profile, identifies gaps, and produces a complete optimization package -- description, categories, services, Q&As, posting calendar, and photo strategy.

Every product has a defined agent workflow. The agents know exactly what data they need, what analysis to perform, and what output to produce.

---

## Step 3: Research and Analysis

Before any agent produces a deliverable, it gathers data. This is the part most humans skip or rush through -- and it is the part that matters most.

For an audit, this means crawling every page on your site, checking every meta tag, testing every Core Web Vital, mapping your internal link structure, pulling your backlink profile, auditing your citations across 50+ directories, scoring your GBP against our 5-SPEC framework, and analyzing the top 5-10 competitors in your market.

For content, this means analyzing the top-ranking pages for your target keyword, identifying the questions searchers are asking, mapping internal linking opportunities to your existing pages, and determining the content structure (headers, word count, subtopics) that the search landscape rewards.

This research phase typically takes minutes -- not the days or weeks it would take a human team. The agents process data at machine speed. That is the fundamental advantage.

---

## Step 4: Execution

With research complete, the agents produce the deliverable.

An audit becomes a scored report with every finding categorized by severity and prioritized by impact. A topical map becomes a structured architecture with keywords, search volumes, difficulty scores, content types, and build order. A content page becomes a fully formatted document with title tag, meta description, headers, body copy, FAQ section, and internal link suggestions. Schema becomes validated JSON-LD ready for deployment.

The agents follow strict output frameworks. Every audit uses the same scoring system. Every content page follows the same structural template. Every schema package passes the same validation checks. This is how we maintain consistency at scale -- the process does not vary based on who is working, because the system is the process.

---

## Step 5: Quality Check

Before any deliverable reaches you, it passes through validation. The checks vary by product:

- **Audits** are validated for completeness (all sections present, all findings scored, all recommendations actionable) and accuracy (data points verified against source)
- **Content** is checked for keyword targeting, header structure, internal linking, meta tag presence, word count, and readability
- **Schema** is run through Google's Rich Results Test and Schema.org validation to ensure it will parse correctly
- **Topical maps** are verified for keyword accuracy, logical grouping, and complete coverage of the target topic space

If a deliverable fails validation, it is cycled back through the relevant agent for correction before delivery. You never see a first draft that did not clear QA.

---

## Step 6: Delivery

You receive a notification that your deliverable is ready. Depending on the product, you will get:

- **PDF report** (audits) -- branded, formatted, ready to share with your team or clients
- **Markdown + HTML** (content pages) -- with full metadata, ready for publishing
- **JSON-LD code** (schema) -- with implementation instructions for your platform
- **Structured spreadsheet** (topical maps) -- organized by priority, with all keyword data included
- **Optimization package** (GBP) -- with all recommended changes, posting calendar, and implementation guide

Everything is accessible through your dashboard and delivered via email. Most products are ready in hours:

| Product | Typical Turnaround |
|---|---|
| Content Pages | 2-4 hours |
| Topical Map | 4-6 hours |
| Schema Markup | 6-12 hours |
| SEO Audit | 12-24 hours |
| GBP Optimization | 24-48 hours |

## What Makes This Different

The traditional model for SEO delivery is: you hire someone, they figure out what to do, they do it when they get around to it, and you hope the output is good.

The CATALYST model is: the methodology is baked into the system, the agents execute it on demand, the output is validated before delivery, and the process is the same whether you order at 9 AM or 9 PM.

This is not AI generating generic content from a prompt. This is a structured execution system where every agent has a defined role, a defined workflow, and defined quality standards. The technology handles the execution. The methodology handles the quality.
