Google Business Profile posts are one of the most underused features in local SEO. They are free, they take minutes to create, and they send direct engagement signals to Google that can influence your local rankings. Yet the majority of local businesses either do not post at all or post so inconsistently that the impact is negligible.

This guide covers the four types of GBP posts, optimal posting frequency, image and CTA best practices, and — most importantly — 10 ready-to-use templates you can adapt to your business today.

## The Four Types of Google Business Profile Posts

Google offers four distinct post types, each serving a different purpose:

**What's New.** General updates about your business — new services, team announcements, seasonal information, tips, or industry news. These are the most versatile and the ones you will use most frequently. They remain visible for approximately seven days.

**Events.** Posts tied to a specific date range — grand openings, workshops, webinars, holiday sales, community events. Event posts remain visible through the event end date, making them longer-lasting than standard updates.

**Offers.** Promotional posts with optional coupon codes, terms, and redemption links. These display with a prominent "View Offer" CTA and are ideal for driving immediate action. They remain visible through the offer expiration date.

**Products.** Showcase specific products or service packages with pricing, descriptions, and direct links. Products appear in a dedicated "Products" tab on your GBP listing and persist until you remove them.

A strong [Google Business Profile optimization](/services/google-business-profile-optimization/) strategy uses all four types in rotation to keep your listing active and diverse.

## Optimal Posting Frequency and Timing

Post a minimum of once per week. Businesses that post 2-3 times per week see the strongest engagement signals. Daily posting is not necessary and can feel spammy if the content lacks substance.

Timing matters less than consistency. However, posting during business hours when your target audience is likely searching tends to produce slightly higher engagement. For most local businesses, Tuesday through Thursday mornings perform well.

The critical point: GBP posts expire after seven days (except Events and Offers with set dates). If you post once and wait a month, your profile shows no active posts for three out of four weeks. Consistency is the entire game.

## Best Practices for Images, CTAs, and Keywords

**Images.** Every post should include an image. Posts with images receive significantly higher engagement than text-only posts. Use high-quality photos (minimum 720x540 pixels) that are relevant to the post content. Original photos of your team, work, or location outperform stock images. Avoid heavy text overlays — Google occasionally rejects images with too much embedded text.

**CTAs.** Every post should include a call-to-action button. Options include: Book, Order Online, Buy, Learn More, Sign Up, Call Now, and Get Offer. Choose the CTA that aligns with the post's intent. "Learn More" linking to a relevant service page on your website is the most universally applicable option and drives traffic to your site.

**Keywords.** Naturally incorporate your target keywords into post content. If you are a plumber in Austin, a post mentioning "emergency plumbing repair in Austin" reinforces your relevance signals for that query. Do not keyword-stuff — write naturally, but be intentional about including your primary service and location terms.

These posts also complement your broader [on-page optimization](/services/on-page-optimization/) by driving engaged traffic to specific landing pages on your site.

## Measuring GBP Post Performance

Track performance directly in your Google Business Profile Insights dashboard. Key metrics include:

- **Views** — how many people saw the post
- **Clicks** — how many clicked the CTA button
- **Click-through rate** — clicks divided by views

Compare post types and content themes to identify what resonates with your audience. Over time, double down on the formats that drive the most clicks. If you are running [local SEO](/services/local-seo/) campaigns alongside your posting strategy, correlate posting activity with ranking movement in your geo-grid tracking data to measure indirect SEO impact.

## Common GBP Posting Mistakes to Avoid

**Posting without images.** Text-only posts get buried. Always include a relevant, high-quality image.

**Using stock photos exclusively.** Google and users can both tell. Original photos build more trust and may receive preferential treatment in display.

**Forgetting the CTA.** Every post should drive an action. A post without a CTA is a missed opportunity.

**Keyword stuffing.** Cramming every keyword into a 150-word post reads as spam. One or two naturally placed keywords per post is sufficient.

**Inconsistent posting.** One post per month is barely better than none. Build a weekly cadence and stick to it.

**Ignoring post expiration.** Standard posts expire after seven days. If you check your profile and see no active posts, you have a gap in your posting schedule.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How long should a GBP post be?**
Between 150 and 300 words is the sweet spot. Google truncates posts after approximately 100 characters in the preview, so front-load the most important information. The full text is visible when users click to expand.

**Do GBP posts directly impact local rankings?**
GBP posts are a confirmed engagement signal. While they are not the strongest ranking factor on their own, consistent posting contributes to profile completeness and activity signals, which influence local pack rankings as part of a broader [GBP optimization](/services/google-business-profile-optimization/) strategy.

**Can I schedule GBP posts in advance?**
Google does not offer native scheduling, but third-party tools like Publer, Circleboom, and Hootsuite support GBP post scheduling. This is the easiest way to maintain a consistent cadence.

**Should I use the same post across multiple GBP locations?**
No. Each location should have unique posts that reference the specific city, neighborhood, or service area. Duplicate posts across locations look templated and miss the opportunity to reinforce location-specific relevance.
