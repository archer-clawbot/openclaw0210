Your Google Business Profile generates a wealth of performance data that most business owners never fully utilize. GBP insights and analytics tell you exactly how customers find your listing, what they do when they get there, and how your profile compares to competitors. Turning this data into action is a critical part of effective [Google Business Profile management](/google-business-profile-management/).

This guide walks through every metric available in GBP analytics, explains what each one means for your business, and shows you how to use the data to make smarter optimization decisions.

## Where to Access GBP Performance Data

Google has evolved how it presents GBP analytics over the years. As of 2026, performance data is accessible in two primary locations.

### GBP Dashboard Performance Tab

Log into your Google Business Profile and navigate to the "Performance" section. This is your primary analytics hub, providing data on searches, views, and customer actions over customizable date ranges.

### Google Search Console Integration

For businesses with a linked website, Google Search Console provides complementary data about how your website performs in search. While this is not GBP-specific, the overlap between local search queries and website traffic provides valuable context.

## Core Performance Metrics Explained

GBP organizes performance data into several categories. Understanding each one is essential for effective analysis.

### Search Queries

The search queries report shows you the actual terms people used on Google before seeing your listing. This is arguably the most valuable data in GBP analytics because it reveals customer intent.

**What to look for:**

- **High-volume branded queries.** If most of your searches are for your exact business name, your listing has strong brand awareness but may not be capturing enough discovery traffic.
- **Discovery queries.** These are non-branded searches like "plumber near me" or "emergency dentist." A healthy profile should generate significant discovery traffic, as these represent new potential customers.
- **Unexpected queries.** Sometimes your listing appears for searches you did not anticipate. These can reveal opportunities, such as services customers associate with your business that you are not actively marketing, or problems, such as irrelevant queries indicating a category mismatch.

**Action items from search query data:**
- If discovery queries are low relative to branded queries, your [GBP optimization](/blog/google-business-profile-checklist/) needs work
- If you appear for irrelevant queries, review your categories and business description
- If high-value queries are not appearing, check whether your categories and services sections address those terms

### Profile Views

Profile views measure how many times your listing was seen, broken down by platform.

**Views on Search.** How often your listing appeared in Google Search results (including the local pack and knowledge panel).

**Views on Maps.** How often your listing appeared in Google Maps results.

**Total views.** The combined total across both platforms.

**What the ratio tells you:**
- A high Maps-to-Search ratio suggests customers are actively using Maps to find businesses like yours, which is common for restaurants, retail, and service businesses
- A high Search-to-Maps ratio suggests customers find you through traditional search queries, which is common for professional services
- Significant drops in either metric warrant investigation, as they may indicate ranking changes, algorithm updates, or competitive shifts

### Customer Actions

Customer actions track what users do after viewing your listing. These are the conversion metrics of GBP analytics.

**Website visits.** Clicks to your website from your GBP listing. This measures how effectively your listing drives traffic to your site.

**Direction requests.** Clicks on the "Directions" button. This is a strong intent signal, particularly for storefront businesses, as the customer is actively planning to visit.

**Phone calls.** Clicks on the "Call" button. For service businesses, this is often the most important conversion metric. Note that this only tracks clicks on the call button, not calls made by manually dialing your number.

**Messages.** If you have messaging enabled, this tracks the number of messages initiated through your listing.

**Bookings.** If you have integrated a booking provider, this tracks bookings initiated through your GBP listing.

**Interpreting customer action data:**
- Compare month-over-month trends to identify growth or decline
- Calculate your view-to-action ratio (actions divided by views) to measure listing effectiveness
- If views are increasing but actions are flat, your listing may need better photos, more reviews, or updated information to convert browsers into leads

### Photo Insights

GBP provides data on how your photos perform compared to businesses similar to yours.

**Photo views.** How often your business photos are viewed, with a benchmark comparison against similar businesses.

**Photo quantity.** How many photos your listing has versus the average for similar businesses.

**Why photo data matters:**
- Listings with more photos than their competitive average consistently generate more customer actions
- If your photo views are below the benchmark, you likely need more photos, better quality photos, or more varied photo types (interior, exterior, team, product/service)
- Photo views that spike after uploading new images confirm that fresh visual content drives engagement

## Benchmarking Your Performance

Raw numbers are only meaningful in context. Benchmarking translates data into actionable intelligence.

### Month-Over-Month Comparisons

Track every core metric monthly. Create a simple spreadsheet that logs total searches, views, and each customer action. Look for trends rather than fixating on individual months, as seasonal variation is normal for most businesses.

### Year-Over-Year Comparisons

Annual comparisons remove seasonal noise and reveal true growth trends. Compare January 2026 to January 2025 for a clearer picture of whether your local search presence is improving.

### Competitive Benchmarking

While GBP does not provide direct competitor data (outside of photo benchmarks), you can estimate competitive performance by:
- Tracking your local pack ranking position for key queries
- Monitoring competitor review counts and velocity
- Observing competitor listing completeness and activity

At LocalCatalyst, our CATALYST Methodology uses geo-grid tracking with SoLV and WVS metrics to provide precise competitive benchmarking that goes far beyond basic GBP insights.

### Industry Benchmarks

Different industries have different performance norms. A restaurant will naturally generate more direction requests than an accounting firm. Research benchmarks for your specific industry to set realistic targets.

## Using Analytics to Improve Your Listing

Data without action is just numbers. Here is how to turn GBP analytics into optimization decisions.

### Low Discovery Searches

If branded searches dominate your query report, your listing is not visible enough for non-branded queries.

**Actions to take:**
- Review and optimize your [GBP categories](/blog/google-business-profile-categories/) to ensure they match high-value search terms
- Expand your services section with detailed descriptions
- Add relevant attributes to your profile
- Build citations and local links to improve domain authority
- Create Google Posts with relevant keywords

### High Views, Low Actions

If people see your listing but do not take action, your listing is not compelling enough to convert.

**Actions to take:**
- Add more high-quality photos (aim for 2x the competitor average)
- Improve your business description with clear value propositions
- Ensure your hours, phone number, and website link are accurate
- Increase your review count and rating through a systematic [review strategy](/blog/google-business-profile-review-strategy/)
- Add products and services with descriptions and pricing

### Declining Phone Calls

If call volume is dropping while views remain stable, something about your listing is discouraging direct contact.

**Actions to take:**
- Verify your phone number is correct and answered during business hours
- Check if messaging or booking buttons are cannibalizing calls (not necessarily bad)
- Review recent negative reviews that may be deterring callers
- Ensure your business hours are accurate, as customers may assume you are closed

### Stagnant Growth

If all metrics are flat over 3+ months, your listing has plateaued and needs fresh optimization.

**Actions to take:**
- Conduct a complete listing audit using a comprehensive [optimization checklist](/blog/google-business-profile-checklist/)
- Post weekly Google Posts to signal activity
- Upload new photos monthly
- Pursue new reviews to maintain velocity
- Update your business description and services section

## Reporting and Tracking Cadence

Establish a regular reporting rhythm to stay on top of your GBP performance.

**Weekly:** Quick check on customer actions (calls, direction requests, website clicks) to identify any sudden changes that need immediate attention.

**Monthly:** Full review of all metrics with month-over-month comparisons. This is your primary optimization checkpoint.

**Quarterly:** Deep analysis with year-over-year comparisons, competitive benchmarking, and strategy adjustments. This is where you make significant optimization decisions.

**Annually:** Comprehensive review of the full year's performance trends, ROI assessment, and strategy planning for the year ahead.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How far back does GBP insights data go?

Google currently provides up to six months of performance data in the GBP dashboard. If you need longer-term tracking, export your data monthly and maintain your own historical records. Third-party tools can also automate this data collection.

### Why do my GBP analytics numbers differ from Google Analytics?

GBP tracks interactions with your listing on Google Search and Maps, while Google Analytics tracks behavior on your website. The "website visits" metric in GBP represents clicks from your listing to your site, which should roughly correlate with referral traffic from Google Maps in your website analytics. Discrepancies are normal due to different tracking methodologies, bot filtering, and user behavior patterns.

### Can I see which search queries led to phone calls or direction requests?

GBP does not currently connect specific search queries to specific customer actions. You can see which queries generated views and you can see total customer actions, but you cannot trace a specific call back to a specific search query. Call tracking numbers and UTM parameters can help bridge this gap.

### How do Google algorithm updates affect my GBP analytics?

Google regularly updates its local search algorithm, and these updates can cause significant fluctuations in your GBP metrics. If you notice a sudden change in search views or customer actions that is not explained by seasonal trends or changes you made to your listing, a local algorithm update may be the cause. Monitor industry news sources for confirmed updates.
