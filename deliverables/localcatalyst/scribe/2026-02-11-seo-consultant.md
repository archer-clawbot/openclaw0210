## H1
`Hire an SEO Consultant Who Actually Understands Local Search`

---

## Intro Content

Most SEO consultants throw around buzzwords like "domain authority" and "backlinks" without understanding what actually moves the needle for local businesses. They treat your plumbing company like it's Amazon. They optimize for national keywords you'll never rank for. And they charge enterprise prices for generic advice.

LocalCatalyst is different. Our SEO consultants specialize in **local SEO** — the kind of optimization that gets you ranking in your city, showing up in the Map Pack, and driving phone calls from customers who are ready to buy.

When you hire an SEO consultant from LocalCatalyst, you're not getting a freelancer who dabbles in local SEO. You're getting a specialist who lives and breathes Google Business Profiles, local search algorithms, and Map Pack rankings.

## What Our SEO Consultants Do

### H2
`What You Get When You Hire a LocalCatalyst SEO Consultant`

Our SEO consultants don't just give advice. We execute. Here's what working with us looks like:

### 1. Local SEO Strategy & Audit

Before we touch anything, we audit your entire local presence:
- Google Business Profile health check
- Local keyword rankings (where do you rank for "[service] near me" and "[service] [city]"?)
- Competitor analysis (who's ranking in your market and why?)
- Citation audit (is your business listed accurately across directories?)
- Technical SEO audit (is your website fast, mobile-friendly, schema-optimized?)
- Review profile analysis (how many reviews do you have, what's your rating, are you responding?)

You get a detailed report with specific, actionable recommendations ranked by impact.

### 2. Google Business Profile Optimization

Your GBP is the most important local SEO asset you have. Our consultants don't just "set it up" — we actively manage it:
- Complete GBP setup and optimization (categories, service areas, attributes, hours)
- Weekly posts (updates, offers, events)
- Photo management (team, work samples, location)
- Review monitoring and professional responses
- Q&A management (seeding helpful questions, answering customer queries)
- Monthly insights reporting (how many people viewed your profile, clicked your website, called you, requested directions)

Most SEO consultants ignore GBP. We treat it as mission-critical infrastructure.

### 3. Local SEO Content Strategy

Local search isn't about ranking for generic keywords nationwide. It's about ranking for **local intent queries**: "[service] near me," "[service] in [city]," "[service] [neighborhood]."

Our consultants build local SEO content strategies that target these searches:
- Service page optimization (one page per service, targeting local keywords)
- Location page development (one page per city/neighborhood you serve)
- Blog content (educational posts that rank for long-tail local queries)
- FAQ schema (capture featured snippets for local questions)

We don't write filler content. Every page has a purpose: rank for a specific local keyword and convert searchers into customers.

### 4. Technical SEO for Local Businesses

Local rankings aren't just about your GBP and citations. Your website needs to be technically sound:
- **Core Web Vitals optimization** (LCP, FID, CLS — Google's page speed metrics)
- **Mobile optimization** (80% of local searches happen on mobile)
- **Schema markup** (LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, Review schema)
- **XML sitemap setup** (help Google discover and index your pages)
- **Canonical tag cleanup** (prevent duplicate content issues)
- **Robots.txt configuration** (control what Google crawls)

Most SEO consultants treat technical SEO as optional. We bake it into every engagement because it's a ranking factor.

### 5. Citation Building & NAP Consistency

Your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) need to be accurate and consistent across every directory online. Inconsistent NAP data kills local rankings.

Our consultants audit, build, and clean up citations:
- Citation audit across 75+ directories
- Manual submission to 50+ high-authority directories (Google, Bing, Yelp, Facebook, industry-specific directories)
- Duplicate listing cleanup
- NAP standardization

### 6. Review Management

Reviews are a top-3 ranking factor for the Map Pack. Our consultants help you generate more 5-star reviews and respond professionally to every review:
- Automated review request campaigns (SMS/email)
- Multi-platform monitoring (Google, Yelp, Facebook, industry directories)
- Professional responses to all reviews (positive and negative)
- Reputation repair (flagging fake reviews, burying old negatives)

### 7. Monthly Reporting & Strategy Refinement

SEO isn't set-it-and-forget-it. Our consultants track performance and adjust strategy based on data:
- Weekly keyword tracking (where do you rank for your top 10-20 target keywords?)
- GBP insights (views, clicks, calls, direction requests)
- Traffic and conversion tracking (which pages are driving leads?)
- Competitor monitoring (are your competitors making moves?)
- Strategy refinement (double down on what's working, pivot away from what's not)

You get a detailed report on the 1st of every month showing what we did, what results we achieved, and what's next.

## Why Hire LocalCatalyst Instead of a Freelancer?

### H2
`LocalCatalyst SEO Consultants vs. Freelance SEO Consultants`

There are thousands of freelance SEO consultants. Most of them are generalists who dabble in local SEO. Here's why LocalCatalyst is different:

### Freelancers Are Generalists. We're Specialists.

Freelance SEO consultants typically handle e-commerce, SaaS, content marketing, and local SEO. They're jacks-of-all-trades, masters of none.

LocalCatalyst consultants **only** do local SEO. We don't optimize Shopify stores or SaaS landing pages. We specialize in getting local businesses to rank in the Map Pack. That specialization matters.

### Freelancers Give Advice. We Execute.

Most freelance SEO consultants charge you $150/hour for advice — then you're stuck figuring out how to implement it. You need a web developer. A copywriter. A GBP manager. And now you're coordinating three vendors.

LocalCatalyst consultants execute everything. We don't just tell you what to do — we do it for you. GBP management, content creation, technical SEO fixes, citation building, review management. It's all included.

### Freelancers Work Solo. We're a Team.

Freelancers are limited by their own time and expertise. If they're on vacation, you're stuck. If they don't know technical SEO, your site stays slow.

LocalCatalyst is a team. You get a dedicated consultant, plus access to specialists in GBP optimization, technical SEO, content creation, and analytics. If your consultant is out, someone else on the team picks up the slack.

### Freelancers Use Generic Tools. We Use Proprietary Systems.

Most freelancers use the same off-the-shelf tools everyone else uses: Moz, SEMrush, Ahrefs. Those tools are fine, but they're not built for local SEO.

LocalCatalyst uses proprietary systems built specifically for local search:
- **SoLV (Share of Local Voice)** — Track your visibility vs. competitors across all local keywords
- **Geo-grid tracking** — See where you rank in every neighborhood/zip code (not just one location)
- **WVS (Weighted Visibility Score)** — Prioritize keywords by search volume and conversion value

### Freelancers Bill by the Hour. We Work on Retainer.

Freelance SEO consultants bill hourly ($100-$250/hour). You never know what your monthly bill will be. You're incentivized to minimize communication to save money.

LocalCatalyst works on fixed monthly retainers. You know exactly what you're paying every month. You can ask unlimited questions, request unlimited revisions, and get unlimited strategic input — all included.

## FAQ Section

### H2
`Frequently Asked Questions`

**Q1: How is hiring an SEO consultant different from hiring an SEO agency?**  
A: Great question. LocalCatalyst is technically an agency, but we operate like consultants. You get a dedicated consultant assigned to your account — not a rotating cast of junior employees. That consultant is your primary point of contact and leads strategy.

**Q2: Do I have to sign a long-term contract?**  
A: No. We operate month-to-month. You can cancel anytime with 30 days' notice. We earn your business every month by delivering results.

**Q3: Will I talk directly to my consultant, or will I go through an account manager?**  
A: You talk directly to your consultant. No middlemen. Your consultant is also your account manager.

**Q4: How often will we communicate?**  
A: Most clients do a monthly strategy call (30-60 minutes) plus ad-hoc Slack/email communication as needed. We're responsive — you'll hear back within 24 hours (usually same day).

**Q5: What if I need help with something outside local SEO (like paid ads or social media)?**  
A: We focus exclusively on local SEO. If you need help with paid ads, social media, or PR, we can refer you to trusted partners.

**Q6: Do you work with businesses outside the USA?**  
A: Currently, we focus on US-based businesses. We're expanding internationally in 2026 — reach out and we'll let you know if we can help.

**Q7: Can I hire a consultant for a one-time project (not ongoing)?**  
A: Yes. We offer one-time audits and one-time optimization projects. Pricing varies by scope. Most clients start with a one-time audit, then move to a monthly retainer for ongoing work.

**Q8: What if I already have an in-house marketing person? Can your consultant work with them?**  
A: Absolutely. Our consultants collaborate with in-house teams all the time. We handle the SEO technical work, your team handles other marketing (social media, email, ads).
