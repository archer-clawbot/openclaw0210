For law firms competing in local search, the Google Business Profile is often the single most visible asset in search results. The local 3-pack appears above organic listings for most attorney-related queries, and the firms that earn those positions capture a disproportionate share of phone calls and direction requests. Within our [law firm SEO](/industries/law-firm-seo/) framework, GBP optimization is a foundational element that compounds the impact of every other SEO investment.

LocalCatalyst's [Google Business Profile management](/google-business-profile-management/) approach for law firms addresses the specific challenges attorneys face: complex category selection, multi-attorney profile management, ethical review generation, and content strategies that resonate with legal consumers.

## Category Selection for Law Firms

Google Business Profile categories directly influence which searches trigger your listing in the local pack. For law firms, category selection requires careful thought because Google offers dozens of legal-specific categories, and the primary category carries the most ranking weight.

### Primary Category Strategy

Your primary category should reflect the firm's dominant practice area or overall positioning:

- **General practice firms:** "Law firm" or "Lawyer" as the primary category
- **Personal injury focused:** "Personal injury attorney"
- **Criminal defense focused:** "Criminal justice attorney"
- **Family law focused:** "Family law attorney" or "Divorce lawyer"
- **Estate planning focused:** "Estate planning attorney"

The primary category should match the keyword you most want to rank for in the local pack. A firm that handles personal injury and family law but generates 70% of revenue from PI cases should use "Personal injury attorney" as the primary category.

### Secondary Categories

Google allows multiple secondary categories. Add every category that accurately describes the firm's practice areas:

- Immigration attorney
- Bankruptcy attorney
- Real estate attorney
- Tax attorney
- Employment attorney
- DUI attorney
- Child custody attorney

Do not add categories for practice areas the firm does not actively handle. Irrelevant categories can dilute ranking signals and generate unqualified inquiries. Google periodically audits category accuracy and may penalize listings with categories that do not match reported services.

## Managing Profiles for Multi-Attorney Firms

Multi-attorney firms face a common question: should each attorney have their own Google Business Profile, or should the firm maintain a single listing?

### The Single-Firm Profile Approach

For most firms, a single GBP listing for the firm itself is the correct approach. This consolidates reviews, citations, and ranking signals into one authoritative listing. The firm name, address, and phone number remain consistent across all directories and citations.

### When Individual Attorney Profiles Make Sense

Individual attorney profiles are appropriate when:

- **Solo practitioners sharing office space** each operate independent practices
- **The firm has multiple physical locations** with different attorneys staffing each office (each location gets its own listing)
- **An attorney has an established personal brand** with significant existing reviews and citations under their own name

If individual attorney profiles exist, they must use the attorney's actual name (not the firm name), and the address and phone number should correspond to where that attorney primarily practices. Duplicate listings for the same address under both the firm name and individual attorney names can create NAP inconsistency issues that harm local rankings.

## Review Strategy for Attorneys

Reviews are the second most important local pack ranking factor after proximity, and for law firms, they carry additional weight because prospective clients rely heavily on peer reviews when selecting legal representation.

### Ethical Review Generation

Bar advertising rules in most jurisdictions permit attorneys to request reviews from clients, but the timing and method matter:

- **Request reviews after case resolution.** Asking for reviews during active representation can create conflicts of interest and may pressure clients who depend on the attorney's ongoing performance.
- **Never offer incentives.** Offering discounts, gifts, or any consideration in exchange for reviews violates both Google's policies and bar ethics rules in virtually every jurisdiction.
- **Use neutral language.** Ask clients to "share their experience" rather than requesting specifically positive reviews. Soliciting only positive reviews violates Google's guidelines.
- **Provide simple instructions.** Many clients, especially older demographics common in estate planning and probate, need clear guidance on how to leave a Google review. A follow-up email with a direct review link reduces friction.

### Responding to Reviews

Every review deserves a response, and attorney review responses require particular care:

- **Positive reviews:** Thank the reviewer without confirming details of their legal matter. A response like "Thank you for your kind words. We appreciate your trust in our firm." maintains confidentiality.
- **Negative reviews:** Never disclose case details, even if the reviewer has. Do not argue facts of the case. Acknowledge the concern, express willingness to address it offline, and provide a phone number. Bar rules in many states prohibit attorneys from revealing client information, even in response to a public review.
- **Fake or defamatory reviews:** Flag through Google's review removal process. Document the review and removal request in case of future disputes. Do not engage publicly with reviews that appear to be from non-clients.

### Review Volume and Velocity

Firms should aim for steady, consistent review acquisition rather than sudden spikes. A pattern of receiving 2-5 reviews per month signals genuine organic review activity. Sudden bursts of 20+ reviews in a week can trigger Google's spam detection filters.

## GBP Posts for Legal Practices

Google Business Profile posts appear on the listing and provide additional engagement opportunities. For law firms, effective post categories include:

- **Legal updates:** Changes in state law, new court procedures, or legislative developments that affect clients
- **Community involvement:** Bar association events, pro bono work, legal aid participation, community sponsorships
- **Practice area highlights:** Brief, informative posts about specific legal topics (not advertising, but education)
- **Firm news:** New attorney additions, awards, notable case results (with appropriate disclaimers), office updates

Post consistently, aiming for at least one to two posts per week. Posts expire from the visible listing after seven days, so regular posting maintains an active, current-looking profile.

### Post Content Guidelines for Attorneys

GBP posts for law firms should avoid:

- Guarantees of case outcomes
- Specific fee information without appropriate disclaimers
- Inflammatory or sensationalized language about legal issues
- Content that could be construed as specific legal advice to a general audience

Posts should include a call-to-action button (Call, Learn More, or Book) that directs users to the appropriate practice area page or contact form on the firm's website.

## Attorney Bio Integration

Google Business Profiles for law firms should leverage the "Team" or individual provider features to highlight attorney credentials. Effective integration includes:

- **Professional headshots** for each attorney listed on the profile
- **Practice area specializations** noted for each team member
- **Bar admissions and certifications** that reinforce E-E-A-T signals
- **Links to individual attorney bio pages** on the firm's website, which should contain structured data markup (Attorney schema)

For firms where specific attorneys handle specific practice areas, the bio integration helps Google understand which attorney is relevant to which type of legal query, potentially improving relevance signals for practice-area-specific searches.

## Tracking GBP Performance With Geo-Grid Analysis

Standard GBP Insights only show performance from one search location, typically the business address. For law firms serving an entire metro area, this creates a misleading picture. A firm might rank #1 when searched from a mile away but be invisible from the other side of the city.

LocalCatalyst uses geo-grid tracking to measure local pack visibility across the firm's entire service area. This reveals:

- Geographic zones of strong vs. weak visibility
- How rankings change as search distance increases
- Where competitors dominate and where opportunities exist
- The impact of optimization efforts across the full service area, not just near the office

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can a law firm have multiple Google Business Profiles?

A firm can have separate GBP listings for each physical office location. Each listing must correspond to a distinct, staffed office where clients can be served. Virtual offices, P.O. boxes, and unstaffed addresses are not eligible. A firm with one office but multiple practice areas should use a single listing with appropriate category selections.

### How important are Google reviews for law firm local rankings?

Reviews are a significant local ranking factor. Both review quantity and average rating influence local pack visibility. However, reviews are one signal among many. Firms should pursue reviews as part of a comprehensive local SEO strategy rather than treating review acquisition as the sole focus. Quality and recency of reviews matter as much as total volume.

## Take Control of Your Local Visibility

Your Google Business Profile is often the first impression potential clients have of your firm. A well-optimized profile with strong reviews, accurate categories, and regular engagement can mean the difference between appearing in the local 3-pack and being invisible in your own market.
