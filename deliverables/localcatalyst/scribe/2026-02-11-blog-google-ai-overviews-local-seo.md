Google's AI Overviews — the generative AI summaries that appear at the top of search results — are no longer an experiment. They are a core part of the search experience, and they are showing up for an increasing number of local queries.

For local businesses, this changes the math on visibility. The search results page that used to consist of ads, a local pack, and ten organic links now frequently includes a multi-paragraph AI-generated summary that pushes everything else further down the page. In some cases, that summary answers the searcher's question completely. In other cases, it reshapes which businesses and sources get attention.

This is not a reason to panic. It is a reason to understand the mechanics, adjust your strategy, and position your business to benefit from the shift rather than be displaced by it.

## What AI Overviews Look Like for Local Queries

AI Overviews for local searches differ from informational AI Overviews in important ways.

For a query like "best emergency plumber in Austin," the AI Overview typically synthesizes information from multiple sources — review sites, local directories, business websites, and forum discussions — into a narrative that identifies several businesses, summarizes their strengths based on available data, and sometimes includes practical information like hours, service areas, or pricing ranges.

For a query like "how to choose a family dentist," the AI Overview provides educational content with general guidance, and may or may not reference specific local businesses depending on the query's specificity and location signals.

For service-specific queries like "cost of roof replacement in Phoenix," the AI Overview generates a pricing summary drawn from multiple sources, often including local market factors, and may reference local businesses that have published detailed pricing content.

The pattern across all three types: AI Overviews pull from the sources that have the most specific, structured, and authoritative information about the topic. Generic content gets ignored. Detailed, well-structured content gets cited.

## Which Local Queries Trigger AI Overviews

Not every local search generates an AI Overview. Based on what we observe across client campaigns, the following patterns hold:

**High trigger rate:**
- Comparison queries ("best [service] in [city]," "[business A] vs [business B]")
- Cost and pricing queries ("[service] cost in [city]")
- Educational queries with local intent ("how to find a [provider] in [city]")
- "Things to do" and recommendation queries

**Moderate trigger rate:**
- Service-specific queries ("[specific service] [city]")
- Review-focused queries ("[business name] reviews")

**Low trigger rate:**
- Direct navigational queries ("[business name] phone number," "[business name] hours")
- Pure "near me" queries where the local pack dominates
- Highly transactional queries where the user's intent is clearly to contact a business immediately

The trend is toward more AI Overviews across more query types. Google is expanding coverage, and queries that did not trigger AI Overviews six months ago may trigger them today. Building your strategy around the assumption that AI Overviews will eventually appear for most of your target queries is the safer bet.

## How AI Overviews Interact With the Local Pack

This is one of the most consequential questions for local businesses: does the AI Overview replace the local pack, compete with it, or coexist alongside it?

The current answer is coexistence, but with tension. For most local queries, Google still displays the local 3-pack (map with three business listings). The AI Overview appears above it, below the ads. In some configurations, the local pack is integrated within or adjacent to the AI Overview. In others, they are separate elements on the page.

The practical effect is that the local pack gets pushed further down the page when an AI Overview is present. On mobile — where most local searches happen — this can mean the local pack requires scrolling past a substantial AI Overview summary. Businesses that relied on local pack visibility as their primary traffic driver may see fewer direct interactions (calls, direction requests, website clicks) from the pack as AI Overviews absorb attention above it.

However, there is a significant upside for businesses that appear in both the AI Overview and the local pack. Being mentioned in the AI Overview and listed in the local pack creates a reinforcement effect — the searcher sees your business name twice in two different contexts, which increases both visibility and perceived authority.

## What Determines Whether Your Business Appears in AI Overviews

Google has not published a definitive guide to AI Overview sourcing for local results, but observable patterns suggest the following factors matter:

**Consistent, comprehensive entity data.** Businesses with complete Google Business Profiles, consistent NAP (name, address, phone) across directories, and well-structured website data are more likely to be referenced. AI Overviews draw from Google's entity graph, and completeness is a prerequisite for inclusion.

**Review volume, quality, and specificity.** AI Overviews frequently reference review data when recommending or describing local businesses. Businesses with a substantial volume of detailed, recent reviews are more likely to be cited. Reviews that mention specific services, attributes, or experiences give the AI system specific claims to synthesize.

**Authoritative, detailed content.** Businesses that publish detailed service descriptions, pricing information, educational content, and FAQ sections provide the raw material that AI Overviews synthesize. A service page that says "We offer plumbing services in Austin" gives the AI nothing useful. A service page that details your emergency response time, service area, pricing structure, and common repair types gives the AI specific information to reference.

**Third-party mentions and citations.** AI Overviews cross-reference multiple sources. If your business is mentioned on local news sites, industry directories, and relevant blogs — not just your own website — the AI system has more confidence in citing you.

**Structured data markup.** LocalBusiness schema, Service schema, FAQ schema, and Review schema provide machine-readable data that helps the AI system understand and categorize your business information. Structured data is not a ranking factor in the traditional sense, but it is an information extraction factor that makes your data more accessible to AI systems.

## Content Strategies for AI Overview Inclusion

Given these factors, local businesses should focus on content strategies that align with how AI Overviews source and synthesize information.

### Publish Specific, Structured Service Content

Move beyond generic service descriptions. For each major service you offer, publish a page that includes:
- Specific description of what the service entails
- Pricing ranges or factors that affect pricing
- Service area details at the neighborhood level
- Time estimates (response time, project duration)
- FAQ section addressing common questions about that service
- Structured data markup for the service and FAQ content

This gives AI Overviews specific, citable information rather than marketing copy that the system will skip over.

### Build a Robust FAQ Architecture

AI Overviews frequently answer questions, and they source answers from content that is structured as question-and-answer pairs. Build FAQ sections into your service pages, location pages, and blog posts. Use the actual questions your customers ask — not manufactured SEO queries — as the basis for these sections.

Mark up FAQ content with FAQ schema so it is machine-readable. This dual-format approach (human-readable FAQ content with structured data backing) maximizes your chances of being sourced by AI Overviews.

### Create Comparison and Decision-Making Content

Queries that trigger AI Overviews most reliably are comparison and decision-making queries. "Tankless vs. tank water heater," "how to choose a roofing contractor," "what to look for in a family dentist." Publishing detailed, balanced content that genuinely helps users make decisions positions you as the authoritative source AI Overviews reference.

This content should be genuinely useful, not thinly disguised sales material. AI Overviews tend to source from content that provides balanced, specific guidance rather than content that reads as promotional.

### Earn Third-Party Mentions

AI Overviews cross-reference sources. Being mentioned on your own website is necessary but not sufficient. Local press coverage, industry directory features, chamber of commerce mentions, and genuine reviews across multiple platforms all contribute to the multi-source confirmation that AI Overviews seem to favor.

This is not a link building exercise. It is a visibility and authority exercise. The goal is for your business to be referenced across the local web in ways that are consistent with your Google Business Profile and website data.

## What Not to Do

**Do not create content designed to manipulate AI Overviews.** Google's AI systems are sophisticated enough to distinguish between genuinely useful content and content engineered to game the system. The same principles that apply to traditional SEO quality guidelines apply here — create content for users, and the systems will follow.

**Do not ignore your Google Business Profile.** GBP data is a primary input for local AI Overviews. An incomplete, outdated, or inconsistent profile undermines your chances of appearing regardless of how strong your website content is.

**Do not abandon traditional local SEO.** AI Overviews are an additional layer, not a replacement for the local pack, organic results, and map visibility. The businesses that perform best are those with strong fundamentals across all local search surfaces.

**Do not obsess over tracking AI Overview inclusion.** AI Overviews are personalized, vary by location, and change frequently. Tracking whether you appear in a specific AI Overview on a specific query from a specific location is less useful than building the underlying authority and content quality that increases your likelihood of appearing across many queries.

## The Long View

AI Overviews are one manifestation of a broader shift: Google is evolving from a link directory into an answer engine. For local businesses, this means the question is no longer just "do I rank on page one?" It is "does Google's AI understand my business well enough to recommend me?"

The businesses that build comprehensive, accurate, well-structured digital presences — across their website, GBP, review profiles, and local web mentions — will be the ones AI systems confidently reference. The businesses that rely on thin optimization tactics will find themselves increasingly invisible as AI-generated summaries absorb the attention that used to flow to traditional search results.

The work required to succeed in an AI Overview world is, fundamentally, the same work that has always defined good local SEO: be genuinely excellent at what you do, make sure the internet accurately reflects that excellence, and maintain that presence consistently over time. AI Overviews just raise the bar on how comprehensively and specifically you need to communicate your value.

Our [local SEO service](/services/) is built around this reality. We do not optimize for one search surface. We build the comprehensive digital presence that performs across local packs, organic results, AI Overviews, and whatever Google introduces next.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Will AI Overviews replace the local 3-pack in Google search results?

Not likely in the near term. The local 3-pack serves a specific function — connecting searchers with nearby businesses for transactional queries — that AI Overviews do not fully replicate. The more likely trajectory is continued coexistence, with AI Overviews handling informational and comparison queries while the local pack handles direct "I need this service now" queries. However, expect the local pack to receive fewer interactions when AI Overviews appear above it.

### How can I check if my business appears in Google AI Overviews?

There is no reliable monitoring tool for AI Overview inclusion because results are personalized by location, search history, and other factors. You can manually search for your target queries from various locations to observe patterns, but building a monitoring system around specific AI Overview appearances is not practical. Focus on the inputs (content quality, entity data, reviews) rather than tracking the output.

### Should I change my content strategy because of AI Overviews?

You should evolve it, not abandon it. The content that performs well for AI Overviews — specific, well-structured, genuinely informative, and backed by structured data — is also the content that performs well for traditional search. The primary change is an increased emphasis on FAQ content, detailed service descriptions, and comparison content that answers decision-making questions directly.

### Do paid ads still appear above AI Overviews?

Yes. Google's current layout places ads above AI Overviews for most commercial queries. This means businesses using Google Ads still get top-of-page visibility regardless of AI Overview content. For local businesses in competitive markets, a combined strategy of [strong organic/local SEO](/services/seo-audit/) and targeted local ads provides the most comprehensive visibility.
