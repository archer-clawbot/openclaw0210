`Service Terms`

### Scope of Work

The scope of work for your engagement is defined in the Agreement. Any additional work requested outside the agreed scope may be subject to additional fees.

### Timeline and Deliverables

We will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the timeline outlined in the Agreement. However, timelines are estimates and may be affected by factors outside our control, including:

- Client delays (e.g., failure to provide required information, access, or approvals)
- Third-party platform delays (e.g., Google Business Profile verification, directory approval times)
- Changes in search engine algorithms or policies

Delays caused by the Client may result in timeline extensions without penalty to LocalCatalyst.

### Client Obligations

To ensure the success of your campaign, you agree to:

- Provide timely access to necessary accounts, platforms, and information (Google Business Profile, website admin access, analytics, etc.)
- Respond to requests for information, feedback, or approvals within 5 business days
- Provide accurate and complete information about your business, services, and competitors
- Notify us immediately of any changes to your business (address, phone number, service areas, etc.)
- Comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and platform policies (Google's terms, Yelp's terms, etc.)

Failure to fulfill these obligations may delay deliverables or affect campaign performance.

### No Guarantees

While we use proven strategies and best practices, **we cannot guarantee specific rankings, traffic, or revenue results**. Search engine algorithms are complex and constantly changing. Rankings are influenced by factors outside our control, including competitor activity, algorithm updates, and user behavior.

We guarantee that we will:
- Execute the agreed-upon scope of work professionally and competently
- Optimize all ranking factors within our control
- Provide transparent reporting on campaign performance
- Make strategic adjustments based on performance data
