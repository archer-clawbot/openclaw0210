# Monthly SEO Content -- Delivered on Autopilot

**Consistent publishing is the single most reliable way to build search visibility over time. Most businesses know this. Almost none of them do it.**

The problem is never intent. It's execution. You plan to write a blog post this week. Then a customer calls. Then payroll is due. Then it's March and you haven't published anything since November.

Hiring a freelancer solves this for about six weeks -- until they ghost you, miss a deadline, or produce content so generic it could be about any business in any city.

We built our monthly content plans so you never have to think about it. Every week, new content lands in your inbox -- written by our AI content system, aligned to your [topical map](/services/topical-map/), and optimized for the keywords that actually drive local traffic.

## Three Plans. Clear Deliverables. No Guesswork.

### Starter -- $297/month
**4 SEO blog posts per month (1 per week)**

Each post is 1,200-1,800 words, fully optimized with target keywords, header structure, internal links, meta tags, and FAQ sections. Topics are selected based on keyword research and aligned to your topical authority strategy.

At $297/month, that's under $75 per optimized post — less than half what most freelancers charge for SEO content, and a fraction of what agencies bill. Each post is built from keyword research, structured for rankings, and aligned to a topical authority strategy. You're not paying for words. You're paying for a system that compounds.

**Best for:** Businesses that need a steady publishing cadence to build organic traffic and topical authority. You handle your own GBP and social channels -- you just need the blog content.

---

### Growth -- $497/month
**4 SEO blog posts + 8 Google Business Profile posts per month**

Everything in Starter, plus 8 GBP posts (2 per week) written to drive engagement, highlight services, and reinforce the keywords your blog content is targeting. GBP posts keep your profile active -- Google rewards profiles that publish consistently with better Map Pack visibility.

**Best for:** Businesses that want their blog and Google Business Profile working in sync. This is the most popular tier because it covers the two content channels that matter most for local SEO.

---

### Authority -- $697/month
**8 SEO blog posts + 12 GBP posts + 2 landing pages per month**

Double the blog output, three GBP posts per week, and two new landing pages (service pages, location pages, or comparison pages) each month. This tier is designed for businesses in competitive markets that need to build content velocity fast -- or agencies white-labeling content for multiple clients.

**Best for:** Multi-location businesses building out city pages, competitive verticals where topical authority is the deciding factor, and agencies reselling content at scale. Agency clients ordering Authority plans for 3+ clients receive priority turnaround and dedicated account coordination.

## Why Consistent Publishing Matters for SEO

Google rewards websites that publish relevant, high-quality content on a regular schedule. Here is what consistent content does for your rankings:

**Builds topical authority.** The more you publish on a subject, the more Google trusts your site as an authority on that topic. A plumber who has 40 blog posts about plumbing problems, solutions, and maintenance will outrank one with 4 -- assuming the content is well-structured and keyword-targeted.

**Creates internal linking opportunities.** Every new page is a chance to link to your money pages -- your service pages, location pages, and contact page. Internal links distribute ranking power across your site and help Google understand your site's structure.

**Captures long-tail traffic.** Blog posts target the specific questions your customers are typing into Google. These long-tail keywords may have lower individual volume, but they convert at higher rates because the searcher has a specific need.

**Feeds your Google Business Profile.** GBP posts are one of the easiest ranking signals to maintain -- yet most businesses never post. Regular GBP content tells Google your business is active and engaged.

**Compounds over time.** Content isn't a one-time cost. A blog post published today can drive traffic for years. The businesses that publish consistently for 12 months build an asset that their competitors can't replicate overnight.

## How It Works

### 1. We Plan Your Content Calendar
If you already have a [topical map](/services/topical-map/) from us, we use it to plan each month's content -- targeting the highest-priority topics in sequence. If you don't have one, we'll build a content calendar based on keyword research for your industry and market.

### 2. Content Is Delivered Weekly
You won't get four posts dumped on you at the end of the month. Content is delivered on a weekly schedule -- giving you a steady stream to publish, share, and promote. Each deliverable includes the full post in markdown and HTML, plus all metadata (title tag, meta description, target keywords, suggested internal links).

### 3. You Publish or We Publish
You can upload the content to your site yourself, hand it to your developer, or add our [WordPress deployment option](/services/content-pages/) and we'll publish directly to your site. Your call.

### 4. Rinse and Repeat
Every month, the calendar advances. Topics build on each other. Your topical authority deepens. Rankings climb. This is how local businesses build search moats that competitors can't easily breach.

## Pair It With a Topical Map

The most effective content plans start with a [Topical Map ($397)](/services/topical-map/). A topical map gives you the complete keyword architecture for your business -- every topic, every keyword, every content gap, organized by priority. When you pair a topical map with a monthly content plan, every piece of content we produce fits into a deliberate strategy. No random blog posts. No wasted effort.

**Don't have a topical map yet?** [Order one here](/services/topical-map/) and we'll use it to build your first month's content calendar before your subscription starts.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I change my plan tier month to month?**
Yes. Upgrade or downgrade at any time. No penalty, no lock-in. Changes take effect at the start of your next billing cycle.

**Do I get to approve topics before you write?**
You'll receive your content calendar for the month before production begins. You can swap topics, adjust priorities, or add specific angles. Once approved, we execute.

**What if I need a revision?**
Every deliverable includes one round of revisions. If something doesn't match your brand voice or misses a key point, we'll fix it.

**Can I provide my own topics?**
Absolutely. Send us a list and we'll work them into the calendar alongside our keyword-researched suggestions.

**Is the content AI-generated?**
Content is produced by our AI writing system, which is trained on SEO best practices and optimized for search performance. Every piece follows our CATALYST content framework -- researched keywords, proper structure, internal linking, and E-E-A-T signals built in.

**Do you offer white label?**
Yes. The Authority tier is popular with agencies who resell content to their own clients. All branding is removed -- deliverables arrive clean and ready for your client's site.
