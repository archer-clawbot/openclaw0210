## HERO SECTION

### H1
**We Help Local Businesses Dominate Their Markets**

### Subheadline
LocalCatalyst is a local SEO agency built on one principle: local businesses deserve the same data-driven, technical SEO expertise that enterprise companies get. We bring that expertise to your market.

---

## MAIN CONTENT

### H2: Our Story

LocalCatalyst was founded on a frustration: watching talented local businesses lose to inferior competitors simply because they didn't rank in Google.

Most local SEO agencies offer the same tired playbook — claim your Google Business Profile, build some citations, ask for reviews, and hope for the best. That approach worked in 2015. It doesn't work in 2026.

Modern local SEO requires:
- **Technical SEO expertise** (Core Web Vitals, JavaScript rendering, schema markup)
- **Strategic content optimization** (not just keyword stuffing)
- **Data-driven tracking** (geo-grid rankings, Share of Local Voice, competitive displacement)
- **AI optimization** (LLM visibility, AI Overview citation engineering)

We built LocalCatalyst to deliver enterprise-level SEO to local businesses who need results, not reports.

---

### H2: Our Methodology: The APEX Framework

We don't guess. We don't rely on outdated tactics. We use our proprietary **APEX methodology** — a systematic, data-driven framework for local SEO domination.

#### The APEX Framework Components:

**A — Audit & Analysis**
- Comprehensive technical SEO audit
- GBP optimization scoring (5-SPEC framework)
- Competitive analysis and gap identification
- Keyword research and intent mapping

**P — Prioritize & Plan**
- ROI-based prioritization (highest-impact optimizations first)
- Custom roadmap with timeline and milestones
- Clear deliverables and success metrics

**E — Execute & Engineer**
- GBP optimization (SPEC-001 through SPEC-005)
- Technical SEO implementation
- On-page content optimization
- Strategic link acquisition

**X — Expand & Accelerate**
- Ongoing optimization and refinement
- Content expansion and authority building
- Competitive monitoring and adjustment
- Scale what works, kill what doesn't

This isn't a one-size-fits-all template. Every business gets a custom strategy based on their market, competition, and goals.

### H2: What Makes Us Different

#### We're Technical SEO Experts Who Specialize in Local

Most local SEO agencies understand citations and reviews but can't read a crawl report or implement schema markup.

Most technical SEO agencies understand site architecture but have no idea how to optimize a Google Business Profile.

**We do both.** We bring technical SEO depth to local SEO strategy.

---

#### We Track What Matters: Real Visibility, Not Vanity Metrics

We don't report "average ranking position" — that number is meaningless for local businesses.

**We track:**
- **Geo-grid rankings** (heat maps showing exactly where you rank across your service area)
- **SoLV (Share of Local Voice)** (your % of total Map Pack appearances vs. competitors)
- **WVS (Weighted Visibility Score)** (position-weighted ranking quality)
- **Competitive displacement** (when you overtake a competitor)

You'll always know exactly where you stand in your market.

---

#### We Optimize for 2026, Not 2016

Local SEO is evolving faster than ever:
- **AI Overviews** are replacing traditional search results
- **LLM-powered assistants** (ChatGPT, Perplexity) are answering local queries
- **E-E-A-T signals** (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trust) matter more than ever
- **Core Web Vitals** are table stakes, not competitive advantages

We optimize your business for the search landscape of today and tomorrow.

---

#### We're Transparent About What We Do

No black boxes. No vague "proprietary strategies." No excuses.

Every client gets:
- **Weekly progress updates** (what we did, what's next)
- **Monthly performance reports** (rankings, traffic, conversions)
- **Full access to tracking dashboards** (see your data anytime)
- **Direct communication** (no account manager middlemen)

You'll always know what we're doing and why.
