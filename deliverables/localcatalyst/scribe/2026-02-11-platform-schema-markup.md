## Why Schema Markup Matters

When someone searches for a business like yours, Google shows two types of results: plain blue links and rich results.

Rich results include star ratings, business hours, price ranges, FAQ dropdowns, and service lists -- directly in the search listing. They take up more visual space. They get higher click-through rates. They build trust before anyone visits your site.

The difference between a plain result and a rich result? Structured data. Specifically, schema markup -- a standardized code format that tells Google exactly what your business does, where you're located, what services you offer, and what your customers say about you.

Most local business websites have zero schema markup. The ones that do usually have incomplete or incorrect implementations that Google ignores. That's an opportunity.

## Two Tiers

### Generation Only -- $197
We generate complete, validated schema markup for your business and deliver it as clean JSON-LD code. You (or your developer) paste it into your website's `<head>` section.

Best for: Businesses with a developer or technical team who can handle implementation.

### Generation + WordPress Deployment -- $397
Everything in Generation Only, plus we install the schema directly on your WordPress site. We verify it's rendering correctly, test it in Google's Rich Results Test, and confirm indexation is underway.

Best for: WordPress users who want it done right without touching code.

## What's Included

Every schema markup order includes the following structured data types, customized to your business:

### LocalBusiness Schema
Your business name, address, phone number, hours of operation, geo-coordinates, service area, payment methods, and business description. This is the foundation -- it tells Google who you are and where you operate.

### Service Schema
Individual schema for each of your primary services, including service name, description, service area, and price range (if applicable). Enables Google to show your specific services in search results.

### FAQ Schema
Structured FAQ markup for your most common questions and answers. This is the schema type most likely to generate visible rich results -- the expandable FAQ dropdowns that appear directly in search listings.

### BreadcrumbList Schema
Navigation path markup that helps Google understand your site's hierarchy and display breadcrumb trails in search results. Improves both SEO and user experience.

### Review / AggregateRating Schema
Markup for your business's review data -- average rating, review count, and individual review snippets. When implemented correctly, this puts star ratings in your search listings.

### Sitewide Implementation
Schema isn't a single block of code. Different pages need different schema types. Your service pages get Service schema. Your location pages get LocalBusiness schema. Your blog posts get Article schema. Your FAQ pages get FAQ schema. We map the right schema to the right pages across your entire site.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Submit Your Details
Provide your website URL, business information, list of services, and WordPress admin credentials (if you want deployment).

### Step 2: We Generate and Validate
Our schema agent generates JSON-LD markup for every relevant schema type, validates it against Google's structured data guidelines, and tests it using the Rich Results Test.

### Step 3: Receive or Deploy
- **Generation only:** You receive clean, validated JSON-LD code files organized by page, with instructions for where each block goes.
- **Generation + deployment:** We install the schema on your WordPress site, verify it's rendering correctly, and send you a confirmation report with Rich Results Test screenshots.

---

## Validation Included

Every schema markup order includes:

- **Google Rich Results Test** validation for each schema type
- **Schema.org compliance** check against the latest specifications
- **Error and warning resolution** before delivery
- **Implementation guide** (generation-only tier) with page-by-page instructions

You don't need to worry about whether the code is correct. We test it before you see it.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need schema markup if I already rank well?**
Yes. Schema markup doesn't directly change your ranking position, but it dramatically improves your click-through rate by making your listing more prominent and informative. Higher CTR means more traffic from the same ranking position -- and Google notices that.

**Will this work on non-WordPress sites?**
The generation-only tier works for any website. We deliver clean JSON-LD code that can be added to any HTML page. The deployment tier is currently WordPress only.

**How long does schema take to appear in search results?**
After implementation, it typically takes 1-4 weeks for Google to crawl the updated pages and start displaying rich results. We can't control Google's timeline, but proper schema markup is the prerequisite.

**What if I already have some schema on my site?**
We audit your existing schema before generating new markup. If you have existing structured data, we'll update and expand it rather than creating conflicts. The delivered code replaces or supplements what's already there.

**Can schema hurt my site if it's done wrong?**
Incorrect schema can trigger manual actions from Google, particularly if it includes misleading information (fake reviews, incorrect business data). Our validation process ensures everything is accurate and compliant before delivery.
