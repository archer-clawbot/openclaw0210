Every effective SEO campaign starts with the same question: what are people actually searching for? Keyword research is the process of answering that question with data, then building a site architecture that captures that demand systematically.

At LocalCatalyst, keyword research is the foundation of every [local SEO](/services/) and [on-page optimization](/services/on-page-optimization/) engagement we deliver. We do not guess which terms to target. We follow a repeatable framework that surfaces the highest-value opportunities relative to a business's authority, competitive landscape, and conversion goals.

This guide walks through that framework step by step.

## Step 1: Seed Keyword Generation

Seed keywords are the starting terms that open the door to broader research. They represent the core products, services, and topics your business covers. The goal at this stage is volume of ideas, not precision.

**Sources for seed keywords:**

- **Your service and product pages.** List every service you offer in plain language. "Roof repair," "emergency plumber," "family law attorney" — these are seeds.
- **Customer language.** Review inquiry emails, chat logs, and sales call notes. The exact phrases customers use to describe their problems are often different from industry jargon and frequently match real search queries.
- **Competitor websites.** Visit five to ten competitor homepages and service pages. Note the terms they use in their headings, title tags, and page copy.
- **Google autocomplete and related searches.** Type each seed into Google and document the autocomplete suggestions and "People Also Ask" questions. These are real user queries.
- **Google Business Profile insights.** If you have GBP access, the search queries report shows the actual terms people used before clicking on your listing. This is first-party search demand data tied directly to your business. Our [GBP optimization service](/services/gbp-optimization/) uses this data as a primary research input.

A solid seed list for a local business typically contains 30 to 80 terms before expansion.

## Step 2: Keyword Expansion and Competitor Analysis

With seed keywords in hand, expand the list using professional research tools and competitor intelligence.

### Tool-Driven Expansion

- **Ahrefs Keywords Explorer** — Enter seed terms to generate thousands of related keywords with search volume, keyword difficulty (KD), click metrics, and SERP feature data. The "Also rank for" and "Questions" reports are particularly valuable for uncovering subtopics.
- **SEMrush Keyword Magic Tool** — Organizes keyword variations into topical groups automatically, making it easier to identify clusters. The intent classification column saves manual categorization time.
- **Google Keyword Planner** — Best for validating volume estimates and discovering terms you may not find in third-party tools. Most useful when filtered by geographic location for local keyword research.
- **Google Search Console** — Your own performance data. Filter by pages and queries to find keywords your site already ranks for on pages two and three. These "striking distance" keywords are often the fastest wins.

### Competitor Keyword Analysis

Competitor analysis reveals the keywords driving traffic to businesses in your market that you have not yet targeted.

In Ahrefs or SEMrush, run a competitor domain through the organic keywords report. Filter for keywords where the competitor ranks in the top 10 but your domain does not appear. This "content gap" analysis produces a prioritized list of opportunities you are currently missing.

For local businesses, prioritize competitors who rank in both the local pack and organic results. Their keyword profiles often reveal locally modified terms that pure organic competitors miss.

## Step 3: Search Intent Classification

Raw keyword lists are useless without intent classification. A keyword's intent determines the type of content you need to create to rank for it.

The four intent categories:

- **Informational** — The searcher wants to learn something. Examples: "how to fix a leaking faucet," "what is local SEO." Content format: blog posts, guides, how-to articles.
- **Navigational** — The searcher is looking for a specific brand or website. Examples: "LocalCatalyst reviews," "Yelp login." These are generally not targetable unless they reference your brand.
- **Transactional** — The searcher is ready to take action. Examples: "local SEO services near me," "hire a plumber Austin." Content format: service pages, landing pages with clear CTAs.
- **Local** — A subset of transactional intent with explicit or implicit geographic qualification. Examples: "best dentist in Denver," "emergency HVAC repair 75201." Content format: location pages, GBP-optimized listings, service-area pages.

**How to classify intent:** Search the keyword in Google and examine the top five results. If they are all blog posts, the intent is informational. If they are service pages with pricing, it is transactional. If the local pack dominates, it is local. Never assume intent. Let the SERP tell you.

Mismatched intent is the most common reason good content fails to rank. Publishing a blog post for a transactional keyword, or a service page for an informational query, puts you in direct conflict with what Google has determined the searcher wants.

## Step 4: Keyword Difficulty Assessment

Not every keyword is worth pursuing right now. Keyword difficulty estimates how hard it will be to rank in the top 10 based on the authority and content quality of the current ranking pages.

**Factors we evaluate:**

- **Domain authority of ranking pages.** If the top 10 is dominated by sites with DR 70+ and your domain is DR 25, that keyword is a long-term target, not a quick win.
- **Content depth of ranking pages.** Thin, outdated content in the top 10 signals an easier opportunity, even if the domains are strong.
- **SERP feature competition.** Keywords with featured snippets, AI overviews, or knowledge panels reduce the available organic real estate. Factor this into your difficulty assessment.
- **Local pack presence.** For local businesses, keywords that trigger a local pack are often more accessible because [GBP optimization](/services/gbp-optimization/) and proximity signals can overcome domain authority gaps.

We categorize keywords into three tiers:

1. **Quick wins** — Striking distance keywords (positions 5-20) with moderate difficulty. Optimize existing pages.
2. **Medium-term targets** — Relevant keywords with higher difficulty that require new content and supporting internal links.
3. **Long-term investments** — High-volume, high-difficulty keywords that require sustained authority building.

## Step 5: Long-Tail vs. Short-Tail Strategy

Short-tail keywords (one to two words) carry high volume and high competition. Long-tail keywords (three or more words) carry lower volume individually but convert at significantly higher rates and are far easier to rank for.

For local businesses, the long-tail advantage is magnified. "Plumber" is nearly impossible to rank for. "Emergency plumber north Austin weekend" is specific, transactional, and realistically targetable, even for a newer site.

Our approach: build a foundation of long-tail content that targets specific, high-intent queries. As those pages accumulate authority and backlinks, they strengthen the topical cluster, which makes it progressively easier to compete for the broader short-tail terms.

Long-tail keywords also map naturally to the questions real customers ask, making them ideal for FAQ sections, blog content, and [on-page optimization](/services/on-page-optimization/) of service pages.

## Step 6: Keyword Mapping to Pages

Keyword mapping assigns every target keyword to a specific page on your site. This prevents two critical problems: keyword cannibalization (multiple pages competing for the same term) and keyword gaps (valuable terms with no dedicated page).

**The mapping process:**

1. List every existing page on your site with its current primary keyword target.
2. Assign each researched keyword to an existing page or flag it as requiring new content.
3. Group related secondary keywords under the same page as the primary keyword they support.
4. Ensure every page has one clear primary keyword and two to five supporting secondary keywords.
5. Validate that intent matches: informational keywords map to blog posts, transactional keywords map to service pages.

This map becomes the operational document that guides content creation, [internal linking strategy](/learn/internal-linking-strategy/), and [content optimization](/learn/content-optimization-framework/) priorities across the entire site.

## Local Keyword Modifiers: The Local Business Advantage

Local businesses have access to an entire class of keyword modifiers that national competitors cannot target credibly:

- **City and neighborhood names:** "SEO agency Dallas," "roofing contractor Oak Lawn"
- **"Near me" variants:** "dentist near me," "best pizza near me open now"
- **ZIP codes and area codes:** Useful for service-area businesses covering multiple zones
- **Local landmarks and districts:** "coffee shop near Reunion Tower," "plumber Uptown Dallas"
- **Service + location combinations:** "AC repair Frisco TX," "divorce attorney Collin County"

These modifiers create hundreds of targetable variations from a handful of core service keywords. Combined with location-specific landing pages and [Google Business Profile optimization](/services/gbp-optimization/), they form the backbone of local search domination.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I redo keyword research?
A full keyword research cycle should happen at least twice per year. Between cycles, monitor Google Search Console monthly for emerging queries that indicate new opportunities or shifting search behavior.

### How many keywords should I target per page?
One primary keyword and two to five closely related secondary keywords per page. Attempting to target unrelated keywords on a single page dilutes relevance and confuses intent signals.

### Is keyword research different for local SEO?
The core process is identical, but the inputs and modifiers change. Local keyword research places greater emphasis on geographic modifiers, GBP search query data, local pack analysis, and proximity-based intent. Volume numbers are smaller, but conversion rates are typically much higher.

### Should I target zero-volume keywords?
Yes, selectively. Many long-tail and local keywords show "0" volume in third-party tools because the tools cannot measure at that granularity. If a keyword reflects a real customer need and has clear transactional intent, it is worth targeting. We have seen zero-volume local keywords drive consistent monthly leads for clients.

## Turn Research Into Rankings

Keyword research is not an academic exercise. It is the strategic foundation that determines which pages you build, how you structure your content, and where you invest your optimization resources. Without it, every SEO activity is a guess.
