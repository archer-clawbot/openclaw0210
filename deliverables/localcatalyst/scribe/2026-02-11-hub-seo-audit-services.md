## You Can't Fix What You Don't Measure

Most local businesses that come to us have the same story. They've been paying someone for SEO — maybe for months, maybe for years — and they have no idea what's actually been done or whether it's working. They can't answer basic questions: How many keywords do you rank for? What does your backlink profile look like? Are there technical issues blocking your pages from being indexed?

They don't know because nobody ever showed them. Nobody ran a proper audit.

**An SEO audit is not a sales pitch dressed up as a report.** It's a systematic, data-driven analysis of every factor that influences your search visibility. It tells you exactly where you stand, exactly what's broken, and exactly what to fix — in priority order.

At LocalCatalyst, the audit is the foundation of everything we do. It's the "A" in our CATALYST methodology (Audit, Prioritize, Execute, Expand). We don't guess. We don't assume. We measure, diagnose, and prescribe — like a doctor running labs before writing a treatment plan.

Every SEO engagement we take on starts here, because we've learned that businesses waste thousands of dollars acting on assumptions instead of data. A dental practice spending $2,000/month on content creation when their site has 147 crawl errors. A law firm buying backlinks when their on-page targeting is competing with itself across 12 cannibalized pages. An HVAC company optimizing for keywords with zero local search volume while ignoring terms their competitors are ranking for.

**The audit stops the bleeding.** It replaces guesswork with a roadmap.

## The Five Pillars of Our SEO Audit

We don't run a single tool and hand you a PDF. Our comprehensive audit examines five distinct areas of your search presence, each requiring different tools, methodologies, and expertise. Together, they give you the complete picture of your organic visibility.

---

### Pillar 1: Technical SEO Audit

Your website's technical foundation determines whether Google can even find, crawl, render, and index your content. A technically broken site will never rank, no matter how good your content is. Our [technical SEO audit](/seo-audit-services/technical-seo-audit/) examines every layer of your site's infrastructure.

**Crawlability Analysis**

We run full site crawls using enterprise-grade tools to identify every URL on your site and how Googlebot navigates between them. We look for:

- Orphan pages with no internal links pointing to them
- Crawl traps (infinite loops, faceted navigation, parameter URLs)
- Robots.txt misconfigurations blocking important content
- XML sitemap errors (missing pages, including noindexed URLs, outdated entries)
- Crawl depth issues (important pages buried more than 3 clicks from the homepage)
- Redirect chains and loops consuming crawl budget

**Indexation Assessment**

Being crawled and being indexed are two different things. We cross-reference your crawl data with Google Search Console indexation reports and site: operator queries to identify:

- Pages Google has chosen not to index (and why)
- Duplicate content issues creating indexation confusion
- Canonical tag errors pointing Google to the wrong URL
- Noindex tags accidentally blocking important pages
- Soft 404s that waste crawl budget

**Core Web Vitals and Page Speed**

We test every page template against Google's performance thresholds — not just the homepage. Most sites pass CWV on the homepage but fail on service pages, blog posts, or location pages. We identify:

- LCP bottlenecks (slow server response, unoptimized hero images, render-blocking resources)
- CLS culprits (images without dimensions, dynamically injected content, late-loading fonts)
- INP issues (heavy JavaScript execution, unoptimized event handlers)
- Mobile-specific performance problems (your mobile site is what Google evaluates)

**Security and Accessibility**

- HTTPS implementation (mixed content warnings, insecure resources)
- HTTP to HTTPS redirect chains
- Mobile-friendliness across all page templates
- Structured data validation (schema markup errors and warnings)
- JavaScript rendering issues (content that requires JS to be visible to Googlebot)

For businesses with significant technical debt, our [technical SEO services](/technical-seo-services/) address everything the audit uncovers.

---

### Pillar 2: On-Page SEO Audit

On-page SEO is where most local businesses leave the most opportunity on the table. We evaluate every ranking page and every page that should be ranking but isn't. Our analysis covers the factors you control directly on your website.

**Title Tag and Meta Description Analysis**

We audit every title tag and meta description on your site for:

- Keyword targeting (are you targeting the right terms?)
- Length optimization (truncation issues in SERPs)
- Uniqueness (duplicate titles across multiple pages)
- Click-through rate potential (compelling vs. generic)
- Brand consistency

**Header Structure and Content Hierarchy**

We evaluate how your content is organized:

- H1 tag usage (one per page, keyword-targeted)
- Header hierarchy (logical H2 -> H3 -> H4 structure)
- Content depth vs. competitors (thin content that won't compete)
- Keyword coverage (gaps in topical relevance)
- Content freshness (outdated information hurting trust signals)

**Internal Linking Architecture**

Internal links are how you tell Google which pages matter most. We map your entire internal link graph to identify:

- Pages with insufficient internal links (low authority signals)
- Broken internal links (404 errors)
- Over-optimized anchor text patterns
- Missing contextual link opportunities
- Orphan pages disconnected from the site structure

**Image Optimization**

- Missing or generic alt text
- Oversized image files slowing page load
- Missing width/height attributes causing CLS
- Opportunities for WebP/AVIF format conversion

For deeper reading on on-page factors, see our [on-page SEO services](/on-page-seo-services/) hub page.

---

### Pillar 3: Local SEO and Google Business Profile Audit

For local businesses, your Google Business Profile and local search signals are often more important than your website for Map Pack visibility. Our [local SEO audit](/seo-audit-services/local-seo-audit/) goes deep on every local ranking factor.

**Google Business Profile Completeness**

We evaluate your GBP against our 50-point optimization checklist:

- Primary and secondary category selection (most businesses pick wrong or incomplete categories)
- Business description optimization (keyword targeting within 750 characters)
- Service entries (custom services vs. default suggestions)
- Products tab utilization
- Photo quality, quantity, and metadata
- Q&A section (seeded questions vs. empty)
- Posting frequency and quality
- Attributes and special features
- Booking and messaging configuration

**Citation Consistency (NAP Audit)**

Inconsistent Name, Address, and Phone number data across the web confuses Google and erodes trust signals. We audit your citations across:

- Major data aggregators (Data Axle, Localeze, Foursquare)
- Primary directories (Yelp, BBB, Yellow Pages, industry-specific directories)
- Social profiles (Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Your own website (is your NAP consistent across every page?)

We flag every inconsistency — wrong phone numbers, old addresses, misspelled business names, duplicate listings — and provide a complete remediation plan.

**Geo-Grid Ranking Analysis**

We don't just check rankings from one location. We run geo-grid analyses that show you exactly where you rank across a geographic area for your target keywords. This reveals:

- Your actual Map Pack visibility radius
- Areas where competitors outrank you
- The relationship between distance from centroid and ranking position
- Opportunities to expand your ranking footprint

We track this using Share of Local Voice (SoLV) and Weighted Visibility Score (WVS) — proprietary metrics that give you a single number representing your overall local visibility.

**Review Profile Analysis**

Reviews influence both rankings and conversion rates. We analyze:

- Total review count vs. competitors
- Average rating and rating trajectory
- Review velocity (how fast you're accumulating reviews)
- Review content (keyword mentions, service references)
- Response rate and response quality
- Negative review patterns (recurring complaints = operational issues)

For comprehensive GBP optimization, see our [Google Business Profile management](/google-business-profile-optimization/) services.

---

### Pillar 4: Backlink Profile Audit

Your backlink profile is one of the strongest ranking signals in Google's algorithm. But not all links are created equal, and bad links can actively hurt you. Our [backlink audit](/seo-audit-services/backlink-audit/) evaluates the quality, quantity, and health of your link profile.

**Link Quality Assessment**

We analyze every linking domain pointing to your site:

- Domain authority and trust metrics of linking sites
- Relevance of linking sites to your industry and location
- Link placement (editorial vs. directory vs. footer/sidebar)
- Follow vs. nofollow distribution
- Link acquisition timeline (natural growth vs. suspicious spikes)

**Toxic Link Identification**

Some links actively damage your rankings. We identify:

- Links from known spam networks or PBNs (private blog networks)
- Links from penalized or deindexed domains
- Unnatural anchor text patterns (over-optimized exact-match anchors)
- Links from irrelevant foreign-language sites
- Paid link footprints

If toxic links are found, we create a disavow file and remediation strategy.

**Competitor Backlink Gap Analysis**

We pull the backlink profiles of your top 5 local competitors and identify:

- Domains linking to competitors but not to you (acquisition opportunities)
- Link types your competitors are earning (sponsorships, guest posts, local press, directories)
- The link velocity needed to be competitive in your market
- High-value link opportunities specific to your industry and location

For ongoing link acquisition, see our [link building services](/link-building-services/) hub page.

---

### Pillar 5: Competitive Landscape Audit

You don't rank in a vacuum. Your rankings are relative to every other business competing for the same keywords in your market. Our [competitor audit](/seo-audit-services/competitor-audit/) reverse-engineers what's working for the businesses that are outranking you.

**Competitor Identification**

Your real SEO competitors aren't always who you think they are. A plumbing company might be competing against Angi, Yelp, HomeAdvisor, and a multi-location franchise — not just the plumber down the street. We identify every domain competing for your target keywords and analyze:

- Their domain authority and backlink strength
- Their content strategy (what pages are ranking and why)
- Their technical SEO implementation
- Their GBP optimization level
- Their review profile strength

**Strategy Reverse-Engineering**

We document exactly what your top competitors are doing:

- Content types driving their organic traffic
- Keywords they rank for that you don't
- Pages they've created that you're missing entirely
- Schema markup implementations giving them rich results
- Local link sources feeding their authority

**Opportunity Identification**

The goal isn't to copy competitors — it's to find the gaps and advantages. We identify:

- Keywords where you're close to page one (positions 11–20) and need a push
- Keywords competitors rank for with weak content you can easily outperform
- Local directories and link sources competitors haven't discovered
- Content angles and formats nobody in your market has tried
- Emerging search trends in your industry for 2026 and beyond

## Free Audit vs. Comprehensive Audit: What's the Difference?

We offer two levels of SEO analysis, and it's important to understand what each delivers.

### Free SEO Audit (Visibility Scan)

Our **[free SEO audit](/free-seo-audit/)** is a high-level visibility scan designed to show you where you stand and identify the most obvious issues. It includes:

- Geo-grid ranking snapshot for your top 3 keywords
- GBP completeness score
- Top 10 technical issues identified
- Competitor comparison (you vs. top 3 local competitors)
- High-level opportunity assessment

**Turnaround:** 2–3 business days
**Cost:** Free, no obligation
**Best for:** Businesses that want to understand their current position before committing to anything

### Comprehensive SEO Audit (Deep Analysis)

The comprehensive audit is the full five-pillar analysis described above. It includes everything in the free audit plus:

- Full site crawl (every URL analyzed)
- Complete Core Web Vitals audit across all page templates
- Full citation audit (50+ directories checked)
- Complete backlink profile analysis
- In-depth competitor analysis (top 5 competitors)
- Geo-grid ranking analysis across full service area
- Content gap analysis with keyword opportunity mapping
- Prioritized action plan with expected impact scores
- 60-minute strategy call to review findings

**Turnaround:** 5–7 business days
**Best for:** Businesses ready to invest in a data-driven SEO strategy

The free audit answers the question: *"How visible am I?"* The comprehensive audit answers: *"Why am I where I am, and exactly what do I do about it?"*

---

## How Audit Findings Become Your CATALYST Roadmap

A stack of findings without a plan is just information. We turn audit data into a prioritized action plan — the "P" in our CATALYST methodology.

Every finding is scored on two axes:

1. **Expected impact:** How much will fixing this move the needle on rankings and traffic?
2. **Implementation effort:** How much time and resources does this require?

This creates four categories:

- **Quick wins** (high impact, low effort) — these get executed first. Examples: fixing title tags on high-traffic pages, adding missing schema markup, correcting GBP categories.
- **Strategic projects** (high impact, high effort) — these go into the 90-day roadmap. Examples: site architecture overhaul, content cluster creation, comprehensive link building campaign.
- **Low-hanging fruit** (moderate impact, low effort) — these fill gaps between major projects. Examples: image optimization, internal link additions, meta description rewrites.
- **Long-term investments** (moderate impact, high effort) — these enter the 6-month plan. Examples: domain authority building, topical authority development, market expansion.

You receive a documented roadmap with specific tasks, expected timelines, and projected impact. No vague recommendations like "improve your content" — every action item is specific, measurable, and tied to a business outcome.

## What Clients Typically Discover

After auditing hundreds of local business websites, we've identified patterns in what our audits uncover:

**Average findings per audit:**
- 87 technical issues (crawl errors, speed problems, schema errors, indexation issues)
- 23 on-page optimization gaps (missing or poorly optimized title tags, headers, content)
- 15 citation inconsistencies (wrong phone numbers, old addresses, duplicate listings)
- 8 toxic or low-quality backlinks requiring attention
- 12 content opportunities competitors are ranking for that the client isn't targeting

**Most common critical issues:**
- GBP categories that don't match actual services (found in 73% of audits)
- No schema markup of any kind (found in 68% of audits)
- Core Web Vitals failures on mobile (found in 61% of audits)
- Duplicate title tags across multiple pages (found in 54% of audits)
- Missing or inconsistent NAP data across citations (found in 71% of audits)

**The typical "aha" moment:** Business owners are often shocked to discover they rank well in a 1-mile radius around their business but are invisible 3 miles away. The geo-grid analysis makes this viscerally clear — and it's usually the single most powerful data point in the entire audit.

---

## Results You Can Expect

The audit itself doesn't move rankings — but it arms you with the intelligence to make every subsequent dollar and hour count. Here's what happens when clients act on audit findings:

**Within 30 Days (Quick Wins Executed):**
- 15–30% improvement in geo-grid visibility from GBP corrections alone
- Crawl errors reduced by 80%+ from technical fixes
- Core Web Vitals passing across all page templates
- Schema markup generating rich results in SERPs

**Within 90 Days (Strategic Projects Underway):**
- 40–60% increase in organic impressions
- 2–4 target keywords moving from page 2 to page 1
- Citation consistency score above 95%
- Measurable improvement in Share of Local Voice (SoLV)

**Within 6 Months (Full Roadmap Execution):**
- 100–200% increase in organic traffic vs. pre-audit baseline
- Top 3 Map Pack rankings for primary service keywords
- Competitive displacement of 1–2 previously dominant competitors
- Consistent organic lead generation from search

**Example:** A multi-location veterinary practice in Texas came to us ranking in the Map Pack for exactly one keyword — their brand name. Our audit uncovered 211 technical issues, 34 citation inconsistencies across their three locations, and zero schema markup. After 90 days of executing the prioritized roadmap, they ranked in the Map Pack for 28 non-branded keywords across all three locations. Monthly organic calls increased from 12 to 67.

## Why Our Audits Are Different

Most SEO "audits" are automated reports generated by a tool and emailed without context. You get 47 pages of technical jargon, a list of red/yellow/green scores, and no idea what actually matters or what to do first.

**Our audits are built by analysts, not algorithms.**

Yes, we use enterprise-grade tools — but every finding is reviewed, contextualized, and prioritized by an SEO strategist who understands your market, your competition, and your business goals. We don't flag "missing alt text on a decorative image" as a critical issue. We focus on the findings that actually move rankings and revenue.

We also explain everything in plain language. If we tell you that your LCP is 4.2 seconds because of a render-blocking CSS file, we also tell you what that means for your customers and your rankings — and exactly how to fix it.

**An audit from LocalCatalyst isn't a report. It's a strategy session backed by data.**

If you're ready to see what's holding your rankings back, **[request your free SEO audit today](/free-seo-audit/)**. It takes 2 minutes to submit, and you'll have results within 3 business days.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does a comprehensive SEO audit take?

Our free visibility scan is delivered within 2–3 business days. A comprehensive Standard audit takes 5–7 business days, and the Enterprise audit takes 7–10 business days. The timeline depends on the size of your website, the number of locations, and the complexity of your competitive landscape. We don't rush audits — thoroughness is the entire point.

### How much does an SEO audit cost?

Our free audit is exactly that — free, with no strings attached. The comprehensive Standard audit is a one-time investment that varies based on site size and market complexity. The Enterprise audit is priced for multi-location businesses and includes ongoing quarterly re-audits. We provide exact pricing after a brief discovery call where we assess the scope of your site and competitive landscape. Contact us for a quote.

### How is your free audit different from the tools I can run myself?

Tools like Screaming Frog, SEMrush, and Ahrefs generate raw data. Our free audit interprets that data in the context of your specific market and competition. We show you your geo-grid rankings (which no free tool provides), compare your GBP optimization against actual local competitors, and identify the issues that specifically matter for your market. The difference is context and prioritization — knowing which of the 200 issues actually matters.

### Do I need an audit if I'm already working with an SEO company?

Especially then. We audit dozens of businesses each quarter that are paying $1,000–$3,000/month for SEO with no measurable results. The audit reveals whether your current provider is actually doing what they claim. We've uncovered cases where agencies hadn't touched a client's GBP in 6 months, never built a single citation, or were generating "reports" from automated tools without any actual optimization work. Think of it as a second opinion — and it costs you nothing.

### What happens after the audit?

You receive a comprehensive report with prioritized findings and a strategy call to walk through everything. From there, you have three options: (1) Take the findings and execute them yourself or with your current provider. We don't hold anything hostage. (2) Hire us to execute the roadmap through our ongoing [local SEO services](/local-seo-services/). (3) Start with the quick wins and expand the engagement as you see results. There's no pressure and no obligation. The audit stands on its own as a valuable deliverable.

### How often should I get an SEO audit?

We recommend a comprehensive audit annually at minimum, with quarterly check-ins on key metrics. SEO is a moving target — Google's algorithm changes, competitors adjust their strategies, and your own site evolves with new content and technical changes. Our Enterprise audit tier includes quarterly re-audits specifically for this reason. For a deeper dive on audit frequency, read our guide on [how often you need an SEO audit](/blog/how-often-seo-audit/).

### Can you audit my competitors too?

Absolutely — competitive analysis is one of the five pillars of our audit. We analyze your top competitors' technical SEO, content strategy, backlink profiles, GBP optimization, and review profiles. This isn't just to see what they're doing — it's to find the specific gaps and opportunities you can exploit. The [competitor audit](/seo-audit-services/competitor-audit/) component often reveals the highest-ROI opportunities in the entire analysis.

### What tools do you use for the audit?

We use a combination of enterprise-grade tools including Screaming Frog for crawl analysis, Ahrefs and Majestic for backlink analysis, Google Search Console for indexation data, PageSpeed Insights and Chrome DevTools for performance analysis, BrightLocal for citation auditing, and proprietary geo-grid tracking tools for local ranking analysis. No single tool gives the full picture — we layer multiple data sources and validate findings across platforms.
