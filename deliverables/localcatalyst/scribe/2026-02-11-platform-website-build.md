## Most Web Designers Build Pretty Sites. We Build Sites That Rank.

Your website is not a digital brochure. It is a ranking asset. Every page is an opportunity to capture search traffic for a specific keyword. Every technical decision — from hosting to theme to site architecture — either helps or hurts your ability to show up when customers search for your services.

Most web designers do not think about this. They build sites that look good in a portfolio but load slowly, lack structured data, have no internal linking strategy, and ignore the technical foundations that search engines evaluate before deciding which sites deserve top positions.

LocalCatalyst builds WordPress sites with SEO baked into every layer. Not as an afterthought. Not as a plugin you install later. As the foundational architecture that the entire site is built on.

## What Makes an SEO-First Website Different

### Site Architecture That Follows Keyword Strategy

A typical web designer builds a site structure based on what looks logical in a navigation menu. An SEO-first site structure is built around keyword research — every page targets a specific search term, and the site architecture creates clear topical clusters that search engines reward with higher authority.

If you serve 5 cities and offer 4 services, you need 20 location-service pages, not one generic "Services" page. Our site builds account for this from the start.

### Technical Performance That Meets Google's Standards

Core Web Vitals are a confirmed ranking factor. A site that loads in 1.5 seconds ranks better than an identical site that loads in 4.5 seconds. We build on lightweight themes, optimize every image, minimize render-blocking resources, and configure server-level caching. Your site passes Core Web Vitals tests before we deliver it.

### Structured Data That Speaks Google's Language

Schema markup tells search engines exactly what your business is, what services you offer, where you are located, and how to display your information in rich results. Every site we build includes LocalBusiness, Service, FAQ, and BreadcrumbList schema — the structured data types that directly impact local search visibility.

### No Page Builder Bloat

Elementor, Divi, and WPBakery add hundreds of kilobytes of unused CSS and JavaScript to every page load. They make sites easy to build and slow to load. We use lightweight, developer-grade themes that give you full design control without the performance penalty.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to provide content for every page?**
You can provide your own content, or you can order [content pages](/services/content-pages/) from us and we will integrate them into the build. If you have basic information about your services, we can work with that — but dedicated SEO content will always outperform placeholder text.

**Can I edit the site myself after delivery?**
Yes. WordPress is built for non-technical users. We deliver the site with a clean admin interface and documentation for making basic updates — text changes, image swaps, and new blog posts.

**What about hosting?**
We can build on your existing hosting or recommend a provider. We typically recommend managed WordPress hosting (WP Engine, Cloudways, or SiteGround) for the best performance and security. Hosting costs are separate from the build price.

**Do you offer ongoing maintenance?**
Site maintenance is available as a separate product. The build price covers design, development, and initial SEO configuration. Ongoing plugin updates, security monitoring, and content updates are a separate engagement.

**What if I already have a WordPress site that needs SEO work?**
If your existing site is on a solid theme and just needs SEO configuration, a [SEO audit](/services/seo-audit/) product may be more appropriate than a full rebuild. If the site is built on a bloated theme with fundamental performance issues, a rebuild is often faster and more effective than trying to fix a broken foundation.
