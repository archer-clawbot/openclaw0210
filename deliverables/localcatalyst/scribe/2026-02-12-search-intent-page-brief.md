## Content Outline

### Introduction (150-200 words)
- Open with a relatable scenario: "When someone searches 'emergency plumber near me' at 2 AM, they're not looking for a blog post about plumbing history."
- Explain search intent in one simple sentence: the *why* behind every Google search
- Preview the value: understanding search intent = creating content that actually brings in customers
- Brief mention that LocalCatalyst builds every page around search intent

### H2: What Is Search Intent? (300-350 words)

**H3: The Simple Definition**
- Search intent = what the searcher wants to accomplish
- Google's job: match results to that intent
- Your job: create content that fulfills that intent better than competitors
- Analogy: It's like knowing whether someone walking into your store wants to browse, ask questions, or buy right now

**H3: Why Google Cares About Intent**
- Google doesn't just match keywords anymore
- They analyze user behavior: clicks, time on page, pogo-sticking
- If people don't get what they want, Google changes the results
- Example: Search "pizza" and you get local restaurants, not pizza history

### H2: The 4 Types of Search Intent (500-600 words)

**H3: Informational Intent — "I Want to Learn"**
- Searcher wants knowledge, not to buy
- Examples: "how to unclog a drain," "what is TMJ," "best type of flooring for kitchens"
- Content type: blog posts, guides, how-to articles
- Business value: builds trust, captures early research phase
- LocalCatalyst approach: we write educational content that positions you as the expert, then guides them to your services

**H3: Navigational Intent — "I Want to Find a Specific Place"**
- Searcher already knows what they're looking for
- Examples: "Yelp," "Home Depot near me," "[your business name]"
- Content type: homepage, branded pages, location pages
- Business value: captures people already looking for you
- LocalCatalyst approach: optimize your branded pages, location pages, and Google Business Profile

**H3: Transactional Intent — "I'm Ready to Buy or Hire"**
- Searcher is decision-ready
- Examples: "hire electrician Chicago," "book teeth cleaning," "order catering"
- Content type: service pages, booking pages, pricing pages
- Business value: highest-converting traffic
- LocalCatalyst approach: service pages optimized to convert browsers into booked appointments

**H3: Commercial Investigation — "I'm Comparing Options"**
- Searcher is researching before hiring
- Examples: "best HVAC company near me," "top-rated dermatologist," "plumber reviews"
- Content type: service area pages, comparison content, case studies
- Business value: captures customers in decision phase
- LocalCatalyst approach: pages that showcase credentials, reviews, and local expertise

### H2: How to Identify Search Intent (400-450 words)

**H3: Look at the Google Results Page**
- Google has already done the work for you
- What shows up? Videos? Local maps? Blog posts? Service pages?
- If Google shows local service businesses, that's transactional intent
- If Google shows how-to articles, that's informational
- Example walkthrough: search "roof repair" vs "how to repair a roof"

**H3: Read the Actual Search Terms**
- Words reveal intent
- "How to" / "what is" / "why does" = informational
- "Near me" / "best" / "top-rated" = commercial investigation or transactional
- "Hire" / "book" / "schedule" / "buy" = transactional
- Business name searches = navigational

**H3: Consider the Searcher's Problem**
- Put yourself in their shoes
- What stage of the buying process are they in?
- What do they need right now — answers or solutions?
- Example: "water heater making noise" (early research) vs "emergency water heater repair" (ready to hire)

### H2: How LocalCatalyst Uses Search Intent to Rank Your Content (350-400 words)

**H3: We Match Content Type to Intent**
- Every page we write targets a specific intent
- Service pages target transactional searches
- Location pages target "near me" and commercial investigation
- Blog posts target informational searches (and guide readers to services)
- Google Business Profile posts target local transactional intent

**H3: We Write for the Right Stage of the Customer Journey**
- Not every visitor is ready to hire — and that's okay
- Early-stage content builds trust and authority
- Mid-stage content showcases your expertise and local presence
- Late-stage content converts visitors into customers
- We create a content ecosystem that captures all three stages

**H3: We Don't Waste Your Money on the Wrong Intent**
- Example of what NOT to do: writing a "history of dental implants" blog when searchers want to book an appointment
- We audit keywords and search results before writing a single word
- Every page has a clear purpose aligned with what Google is ranking

### H2: Why Search Intent Matters More Than Keywords (250-300 words)
- Old SEO: stuff your keyword everywhere
- Modern SEO: answer the searcher's actual question
- Google is smart enough to understand synonyms, context, and related concepts
- If your page doesn't match intent, you won't rank — even with perfect keywords
- Real example: "best pizza near me" doesn't want a 2,000-word article about pizza history
- LocalCatalyst approach: intent first, keywords second (but we optimize for both)

### Conclusion & CTA (150-200 words)
- Recap: search intent = understanding what people really want
- Getting it right means more traffic that actually converts
- Getting it wrong means ranking for searches that don't bring in customers
- LocalCatalyst builds every page around search intent — no wasted content
- **CTA:** "Want content that actually brings in customers? See how we use search intent to rank local businesses." [Link to How We Write Content page]
- Secondary CTA: "Schedule a free content audit" [Link to contact/demo page]

## Schema Recommendations

- **Schema Type:** Article
- **FAQ Schema:** Add 3-5 common questions (see FAQ section below)

---

## FAQ Section (Schema-Ready)

**Q: What is search intent in simple terms?**  
A: Search intent is the reason behind a Google search. It's what someone is trying to accomplish — whether that's learning something, finding a business, or hiring a service.

**Q: Why does search intent matter for my business?**  
A: If your content doesn't match what searchers want, Google won't rank it. Understanding intent helps you create pages that show up in the right searches and convert visitors into customers.

**Q: How do I know what intent my customers have?**  
A: Look at the Google results for your target keywords. If Google shows service businesses, that's transactional intent. If it shows how-to articles, that's informational. The search results tell you what Google thinks people want.

**Q: Can I rank for all types of search intent?**  
A: Yes, with the right content strategy. You need different pages for different intents — service pages for transactional searches, blog posts for informational searches, and location pages for "near me" searches.

**Q: Does LocalCatalyst optimize for search intent?**  
A: Every page we write starts with search intent analysis. We look at what's ranking, what searchers want, and what will convert for your business — then build content around that.
