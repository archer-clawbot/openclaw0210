## General Questions

### What does LocalCatalyst do?

LocalCatalyst is a [local SEO agency](/local-seo-services/) that helps local businesses rank higher in Google Search and Google Maps. We optimize your online presence — your website, Google Business Profile, citations, reviews, and backlinks — so that when customers in your area search for the services you offer, they find you instead of your competitors. Our work is built on our proprietary [CATALYST methodology](/about/our-process/) (Audit, Prioritize, Execute, Expand), which brings enterprise-level SEO strategy to local businesses.

### What industries do you work with?

We work with local service businesses across a wide range of industries. Our clients include medical practices, dental offices, HVAC companies, plumbers, roofers, restaurants, law firms, real estate agents, home service contractors, auto repair shops, landscapers, veterinary clinics, gyms, salons, and pest control companies. If your business serves a local area and depends on customers finding you through Google, we can help. Our strategies are tailored to the specific competitive dynamics of each industry.

### Do you work with businesses outside of a specific city?

Yes. LocalCatalyst works with local businesses across the United States. Local SEO is fundamentally about optimizing your visibility within your service area — whether that's a single ZIP code or a 50-mile radius. We use geo-grid ranking data to understand and improve your visibility across your entire target area, regardless of where your business is physically located. Our team works remotely, so geography is never a limitation.

### What makes LocalCatalyst different from other SEO agencies?

Three things set us apart. First, our [CATALYST methodology](/about/our-process/) is a systematic, data-driven framework — not a generic playbook. Every recommendation we make is based on audit data specific to your business and market. Second, we use advanced tracking that most agencies don't — geo-grid rankings, Share of Local Voice (SoLV), and Weighted Visibility Score (WVS) — so you see exactly how your visibility is changing across your service area. Third, we optimize for 2026 realities: AI Overviews, LLM visibility, and E-E-A-T signals, not just traditional ranking factors.

### Do you use AI in your SEO process?

We use AI as a tool within our process, but we never use it as a replacement for strategy or expertise. AI helps us analyze competitive landscapes faster, identify content opportunities at scale, and process large datasets during our audits. However, every strategy is developed by our team, every piece of content is reviewed and refined by humans, and every recommendation is grounded in real market analysis. We also optimize our clients for AI visibility — ensuring your business appears in AI Overviews and LLM-generated recommendations, which are becoming an increasingly important source of local leads.

## Services & Process

### What's included in your local SEO services?

Our [local SEO services](/local-seo-services/) cover every factor that influences your local search visibility. This includes Google Business Profile optimization and management, [technical SEO](/technical-seo-services/) audits and fixes, [on-page optimization](/on-page-seo-services/), [citation building](/citation-building-services/) and cleanup, [link building](/link-building-services/), [review generation and reputation management](/reputation-management-services/), [content creation](/seo-content-strategy/), and ongoing performance tracking. The specific scope depends on your plan — see our [pricing page](/pricing/) for details on what each tier includes.

### How does the CATALYST methodology work?

CATALYST is our four-phase framework for local SEO. **Audit** — we conduct a comprehensive analysis of your technical SEO, Google Business Profile, local rankings, citations, backlinks, and competitive landscape. **Prioritize** — we score every finding by impact and effort, then build a custom 90-day roadmap. **Execute** — we implement optimizations in priority order, with weekly progress updates. **Expand** — we monitor results, double down on what's working, pursue new opportunities, and maintain competitive advantage. Read the [full CATALYST process breakdown](/about/our-process/) for details on each phase.

### Do I need a website for local SEO?

A website significantly strengthens your local SEO, but you can start without one. Your Google Business Profile can rank in the Map Pack on its own, and we can optimize it to perform well. However, a well-built website gives you organic ranking opportunities beyond the Map Pack, provides landing pages for specific services and locations, builds authority signals that improve your GBP rankings, and gives potential customers the information they need to choose you. If you don't have a website, our [website design service](/seo-website-design/) can build one that's optimized for local search from day one.

### Can you help with just Google Business Profile?

Absolutely. GBP optimization is a core part of what we do, and it can be a standalone engagement. Our [GBP management service](/gbp-optimization-services/) includes profile optimization, weekly posts, photo strategy, Q&A management, review monitoring, and category optimization. For many local businesses — especially those in less competitive markets — a well-optimized GBP alone can drive significant ranking improvements and new customer inquiries.

### Do you build websites?

Yes. Our [SEO website design service](/seo-website-design/) builds fast, mobile-optimized websites that are engineered for local search from the ground up. Every site we build includes proper schema markup, optimized page structure, Core Web Vitals compliance, and conversion-focused design. We don't just make websites that look good — we build websites that rank and convert.

### Do you do PPC or Google Ads?

Our core focus is organic local SEO — the rankings you earn, not the ones you buy. We don't currently offer PPC management as a standalone service. However, we can advise on how paid and organic strategies complement each other, and we're happy to recommend trusted PPC partners if that's something your business needs alongside SEO.

## Pricing & Contracts

### How much does local SEO cost?

Our plans start at $750/month for single-location businesses and go up to $3,000/month for multi-location or highly competitive markets. The right plan depends on your competitive landscape, goals, and current SEO health. We publish our [full pricing](/pricing/) transparently because we believe you should know what you're paying for before you pick up the phone. We also build custom plans for businesses with unique needs.

### Do you require long-term contracts?

We have a 90-day minimum engagement, after which all plans are month-to-month. The 90-day minimum exists because SEO takes time to produce results — we need at least three months to execute the CATALYST methodology properly and demonstrate measurable progress. After that, you stay because the results justify the investment, not because a contract forces you to.

### Is there a setup fee?

No. The initial CATALYST audit and strategic roadmap are included in your first month's fee. There are no hidden setup charges, onboarding fees, or surprise costs. The monthly price on our [pricing page](/pricing/) is the price you pay.

### Do you offer payment plans?

Our standard billing is monthly, which is essentially a payment plan. You pay month-to-month (after the 90-day minimum). We don't require quarterly or annual prepayment, though clients who choose annual billing do receive a discount. Contact us to discuss options.

### What's included in the free audit?

The [free SEO Visibility Scan](/services/seo-audit/) includes a Google Business Profile audit score, local ranking snapshot, geo-grid visibility map, competitor comparison, top 3 quick wins, and a technical health check. It's a genuine analysis of your current visibility — not a teaser designed to withhold information. The audit you receive as part of a paid engagement is deeper (200+ ranking factors vs. a focused snapshot), but the free version gives you enough data to understand where you stand and make an informed decision.

## Results & Expectations

### How long does it take to see results?

Most clients see initial ranking improvements within 30-60 days, particularly from quick wins implemented during the first weeks. Significant, sustained ranking improvements typically materialize at the 90-day mark, which is why we have a 90-day minimum engagement. Full competitive displacement — where you're consistently outranking established competitors — usually takes 4-6 months depending on your market's competitiveness. We set realistic timelines during our onboarding and track progress against milestones every month.

### Can you guarantee #1 rankings?

No, and you should be wary of any agency that does. Google's algorithm considers hundreds of factors, and no one can guarantee a specific ranking position. What we can guarantee is the process: a thorough audit, a data-driven strategy, consistent execution, transparent reporting, and continuous optimization. We also have a 90-day performance commitment — if you don't see measurable improvement after 90 days of working together, we'll discuss what's happening and make it right.

### What kind of results can I expect?

Results vary by market, competition level, and starting position. Typical outcomes for our clients over the first 6 months include: Map Pack visibility for 60-80% of target keywords, 3-5x increase in Google Business Profile views and actions, measurable increases in phone calls and form submissions, improved geo-grid visibility across the full service area, and growth in review count and average rating. Check our [case studies](/case-studies/) for specific examples with real data.

### How do you measure success?

We track metrics that connect directly to business outcomes. Our core KPIs include geo-grid rankings (how you rank across your service area), Share of Local Voice (your visibility vs. competitors), Google Business Profile actions (calls, direction requests, website clicks), organic traffic to key pages, keyword rankings in both the Map Pack and organic results, review count and velocity, and citation accuracy. You'll see all of these in your monthly report.

### What if I don't see results?

If you're not seeing measurable improvement after 90 days, we have a problem — and we take it seriously. We'll conduct a thorough review of everything that's been done, identify what's not working and why, and either adjust the strategy or have an honest conversation about whether SEO is the right channel for your business. We've never had a client complete 90 days without seeing improvement, but if it happened, we wouldn't hide behind a contract.

### How do you report on progress?

Depending on your plan, you'll receive weekly or monthly progress reports. Every report includes: keyword ranking changes, geo-grid visibility updates, GBP performance metrics (views, actions, calls), organic traffic data, work completed during the period, and work planned for the next period. You'll also have regular strategy calls (monthly or bi-weekly, depending on plan) where we walk through the data and discuss next steps. All reporting is accessible through a client dashboard.

## Technical Questions

### What is local SEO vs. regular SEO?

Regular (or "traditional") SEO focuses on ranking your website in organic search results for any searcher, regardless of location. Local SEO specifically focuses on ranking your business for searches with local intent — queries where Google shows a Map Pack, local business results, or results filtered by geographic area. Local SEO involves optimizing your Google Business Profile, building local citations, earning reviews, and ensuring your website signals local relevance. If your business serves a specific geographic area, local SEO is the most important type of SEO for you.

### What is a Google Business Profile and why does it matter?

Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is your business listing on Google. It's what appears in Google Maps and in the Map Pack — the box of three local businesses that shows up at the top of search results for local queries. For most local businesses, the GBP drives more leads than the website itself. It displays your hours, phone number, reviews, photos, services, and location. An optimized GBP is the single fastest path to more local visibility, which is why [GBP optimization](/gbp-optimization-services/) is a core part of every plan we offer.

### What are citations and why do they matter?

Citations are mentions of your business's Name, Address, and Phone number (NAP) on external websites — directories like Yelp, Yellow Pages, BBB, Healthgrades, Angi, and dozens of others. Citations matter because Google uses them to verify your business's legitimacy and accuracy. Consistent citations across many authoritative directories strengthen your local ranking signals. Inconsistent citations — different phone numbers, old addresses, misspelled names — confuse Google and erode trust. Our [citation building service](/citation-building-services/) ensures your NAP is accurate and consistent across 50+ directories.

### How do online reviews impact my rankings?

Reviews are one of the most powerful local ranking factors. Google considers your review count, average rating, review velocity (how frequently you get new reviews), and the keywords mentioned in review text. Beyond rankings, reviews directly influence whether a searcher clicks on your listing or chooses a competitor. A business with 200 reviews and a 4.8 rating will outperform one with 15 reviews and a 4.2 rating — both in rankings and in conversions. Our [reputation management service](/reputation-management-services/) helps you systematically generate authentic reviews and manage your online reputation.
