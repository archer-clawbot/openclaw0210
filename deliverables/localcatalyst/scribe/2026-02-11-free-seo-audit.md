## See Exactly Where You Rank, Where You're Losing, and What to Fix — Delivered in 24 Hours

Your competitors are showing up when customers search. Are you? Most local business owners have no idea where they actually rank — or how much business they're losing to competitors who invested in local SEO.

Our free SEO Visibility Scan gives you the answer. No guesswork. No vague promises. Just a clear, data-driven snapshot of your current local search presence and the specific steps to improve it.

- **Local Ranking Snapshot** — Where you currently rank for your most important keywords in organic search and the Map Pack
- **Geo-Grid Visibility Map** — A visual map showing how you rank across your entire service area, not just from your office address

## Who This Is For

This audit is built for local businesses that want clarity about their search visibility. It's right for you if:

- **You're not showing up in Google Maps** — Customers search for your service, but they find your competitors instead
- **You're stuck on page 2 or beyond** — You know you should be ranking higher but can't figure out what's holding you back
- **You want a second opinion** — You're already paying for SEO and want to know if it's actually working
- **You're just curious** — You've heard about local SEO but aren't sure where you stand or what it could do for your business

Whether you're a [dentist](/industries/dental-seo/), [plumber](/industries/plumber-seo/), [law firm](/industries/lawyer-seo/), or any other local business — if customers find you through Google, this audit will show you opportunities you're missing.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Is this really free?
Yes. There's no catch, no credit card, and no obligation. We offer this audit because it's the best way to demonstrate the value of data-driven local SEO. Most businesses that see their data want to do something about it — but there's absolutely no pressure.

### How is this different from automated SEO tools?
Tools like Moz, SEMrush, and Ubersuggest give you raw numbers without context. Our audit is reviewed by a real analyst who understands your market, evaluates your specific competitors, and provides recommendations tailored to your business. You get strategy, not just data.

### What happens after I get my audit?
That's entirely up to you. Some businesses take the audit and implement the recommendations themselves. Others decide they want help and explore our [service plans](/pricing/). We'll walk you through the findings on a quick call if you'd like, but there's no obligation to do anything beyond reading the report.
