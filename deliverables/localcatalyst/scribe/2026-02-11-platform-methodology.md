## Not a Marketing Acronym. The Actual Execution Framework.

CATALYST is not something we invented for a sales deck. It is the operational framework that every [AI agent](/platform/technology/) in our system follows when producing your deliverables. It defines what data gets collected, how priorities are set, how work gets executed, and how results get measured.

Every product on the platform maps to specific phases of CATALYST. When you buy an audit, you are buying phases C-A-T-A. When you buy content, you are buying phases A-L. When you buy managed SEO, you are buying the entire cycle on repeat.

Understanding CATALYST helps you understand why we deliver what we deliver, and why it works.

## The 8 Phases

### C — Crawl and Collect

Everything starts with data. Before any recommendation is made or any content is written, our system crawls your website, your Google Business Profile, your citation profile, and your competitors.

This phase collects:

- Full technical site crawl (every URL, status code, redirect chain, page speed metric, and rendering issue)
- GBP profile data (categories, attributes, posts, photos, reviews, Q&A)
- Citation audit (NAP consistency across directories)
- Backlink profile (referring domains, anchor text distribution, link quality)
- Competitive landscape (top 10 local competitors across organic and map pack results)
- Keyword universe (every relevant search term with volume, difficulty, and current ranking position)

The Crawl phase is handled primarily by **Scout**, our research and reconnaissance agent. Scout does not guess. Scout crawls, collects, and structures the raw data that everything else depends on.

### A — Analyze

Raw data is useless without interpretation. The Analyze phase takes everything Scout collected and scores it against the factors that actually determine local search rankings.

**Silas**, our strategy agent, evaluates over 200 ranking factors across five categories: technical health, on-page optimization, off-site authority, GBP optimization, and content coverage. Each factor is scored against your top local competitors — not against some theoretical benchmark, but against the businesses you actually need to outrank.

The output is a gap analysis: here is where you stand, here is where your competitors stand, and here is exactly what separates you from the top positions.

### T — Target

Not every gap deserves the same urgency. The Target phase prioritizes opportunities by a simple formula: **impact multiplied by effort**.

A title tag fix that takes 5 minutes and could move a high-volume keyword? That is priority one. A site migration that takes 3 months and might improve rankings marginally? That can wait.

Silas builds a prioritized roadmap — a ranked list of actions ordered by the fastest path to measurable results. This roadmap is the backbone of every audit report and the execution plan for managed SEO clients.

### A — Activate

Activate is where work gets done. The prioritized roadmap from the Target phase is broken into discrete tasks, and each task is assigned to the agent built for that discipline.

- Technical fixes go to **Wrench**
- Content creation goes to **Scribe**
- GBP optimization goes to **Herald**
- Citation building goes to **Ghost**
- Conversion optimization goes to **Razor**

No single agent tries to do everything. The right specialist handles the right task. This is the core architectural principle of our [18-agent system](/platform/technology/).

When you buy individual products from the platform, you are buying the Activate phase for a specific discipline. When you buy managed SEO, you are buying Activate across all disciplines simultaneously.

### L — Leverage

SEO compounds. The Leverage phase identifies what is working and amplifies it.

A blog post that is ranking on page two for a high-value keyword? Leverage means building internal links to it, acquiring a backlink to it, and expanding the supporting content around it until it moves to page one.

A service page that is converting at 8%? Leverage means replicating that page structure across other service lines.

Leverage is the difference between doing SEO work and getting SEO results. Most agencies execute tasks without ever circling back to amplify what worked. CATALYST builds amplification into the process.

### Y — Yield

You cannot manage what you do not measure. The Yield phase tracks the metrics that matter:

- **Geo-grid rankings** — Where you rank for target keywords across your service area, not just from one location
- **Share of Local Voice (SoLV)** — Your visibility as a percentage of total local search real estate
- **Weighted Visibility Score (WVS)** — Rankings weighted by search volume and position to give a single performance number
- **Conversion metrics** — Calls, form submissions, direction requests, and the revenue they generate

These are not vanity metrics. They are the numbers that tell you whether the work is producing a return on investment. Every deliverable is measured against these KPIs.

### S — Scale

Scale is Leverage applied at the strategic level. Once the core service area and keyword set are performing, Scale expands the campaign:

- New service area pages targeting adjacent cities
- New content verticals targeting related services
- Multi-location expansion for growing businesses
- New keyword categories as your authority grows

Scale is where managed SEO clients see the compounding effect in full force. The foundation built in earlier phases supports expansion that would be impossible without it.

### T — Track

SEO is not a project. It is an ongoing competition. The Track phase monitors your rankings, your competitors, and the search landscape continuously.

**Lookout**, our competitor intelligence agent, watches for:

- Competitor ranking changes and new content
- Algorithm updates and their impact on your positions
- New competitors entering your market
- Shifts in search behavior or keyword demand

When something changes, the system responds. A competitor publishes a new page targeting your best keyword? The system flags it and recommends a response. An algorithm update shifts ranking factors? The system adjusts priorities accordingly.

Track closes the loop and feeds back into Crawl, making CATALYST a continuous cycle rather than a one-time process.

## How Products Map to CATALYST

| Product | CATALYST Phases |
|---|---|
| SEO Audit | C - A - T - A |
| Topical Map | C - A - T |
| Content Pages | A - L |
| Citation Building | A (Activate) |
| Technical SEO Fix | A (Activate) |
| GBP Optimization | A - L |
| Website Build | C - A - T - A |
| Managed SEO | C - A - T - A - L - Y - S - T (full cycle) |

Every product runs through the methodology. The difference is scope — individual products execute specific phases, while managed SEO runs the complete cycle on a continuous loop.

## Proven on Real Campaigns

CATALYST was developed and refined over 20+ real client campaigns before we opened this platform. It was not designed in theory — it was built by running audits, executing optimizations, measuring results, and iterating until the process consistently produced rankings growth.

The [case studies](/case-studies/) show CATALYST in action: the specific phases that drove specific results for real businesses.
