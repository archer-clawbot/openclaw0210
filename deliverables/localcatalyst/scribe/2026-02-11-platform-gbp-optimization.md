## Your Google Business Profile Is Your Most Valuable Ranking Asset

For local businesses, the Google Business Profile drives more visibility than the website itself. When someone searches "plumber near me" or "dentist in Austin," the map pack appears above the organic results. Three businesses get featured. Everyone else gets buried.

The businesses in the map pack don't get there by accident. They have complete, optimized profiles with the right categories, keyword-rich descriptions, active posting schedules, strong review signals, and comprehensive Q&A sections.

Most business owners set up their GBP once and never touch it again. The description is generic. The categories are wrong or incomplete. There are no Q&As. No posts. The services section is empty. Google has almost nothing to work with -- so it shows someone else.

This is a fixable problem. And we fix it in 48 hours.

## What We Optimize

### Business Description
Your GBP description is 750 characters of prime real estate. Most businesses waste it with generic copy like "We've been serving the community for 20 years." We rewrite it to include your primary keywords, service area, key differentiators, and a clear call to action -- all within Google's guidelines.

### Categories
Google allows one primary category and up to nine secondary categories. The right combination directly affects which searches your profile appears for. We audit your current categories against competitor profiles and search demand, then recommend the optimal set.

### Services and Products
The services section is an underused ranking signal. We build out complete service listings with keyword-optimized names and descriptions. Each entry becomes another data point Google uses to match your profile with relevant searches.

### Q&A Section
Google's Q&A section is open to anyone -- including your competitors. We pre-seed 10-15 questions and answers that cover your most common customer inquiries, target relevant keywords, and prevent misinformation from showing up on your profile.

### Posting Strategy
GBP posts signal to Google that your business is active and engaged. A consistent posting schedule -- even once or twice a week -- correlates with stronger map pack presence. We build a 30-day calendar with topics tied to your services and seasonal demand.

### Attributes and Details
Business hours, holiday hours, payment methods, accessibility features, amenities, health and safety practices -- every attribute Google offers for your business type, filled in completely. Completeness is a ranking signal. Most competitors skip these.

## This Is a Product, Not a Service

You're not hiring us to manage your GBP for the next 6 months. You're ordering a deliverable.

We optimize your profile, deliver the results, and you're done. If you want ongoing GBP management, you can order the posts tier monthly or explore our [managed SEO](/managed/) option. But there's no contract, no retainer, and no commitment beyond the single order.

**Order it. Receive it. Implement it. Move on.**

---

## What You Provide

- **Google Business Profile access** -- Editor or Owner access to your GBP (we'll walk you through it if needed)
- **Business details** -- Services offered, service areas, hours, and any unique selling points
- **Photos** (optional) -- If you have business photos you want us to incorporate into the posting strategy. Not required.

We handle everything else.

## How We Compare

Most GBP optimization services fall into two categories: DIY tools that give you a checklist but no execution, or agencies that bundle GBP into a monthly retainer starting at $500+/month. Local SEO agencies typically charge $300-500 for a one-time GBP setup — but require a retainer to maintain it. We deliver a complete, ready-to-implement optimization package at a one-time price with no ongoing commitment.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do you need my Google account login?**
No. You add our optimization team as a Manager on your Google Business Profile. We never need your personal Google credentials. You can remove access after the optimization is complete.

**How do I implement the changes?**
For the standard tier, we deliver a document with every change specified -- copy it into your GBP field by field. It takes about 30 minutes. For the posts tier, the posts are delivered ready to copy-paste into the GBP posting interface, one at a time on the dates specified in the calendar.

**Will this guarantee I rank in the map pack?**
No one can guarantee map pack rankings. Google's local algorithm considers proximity, relevance, and prominence. GBP optimization directly improves the relevance and prominence signals. Combined with strong reviews and a well-optimized website, it significantly increases your probability of map pack placement.

**What if my GBP has been suspended?**
We don't handle suspension recovery as part of this product. If your profile is currently suspended, resolve that first (Google has a reinstatement process), then order optimization once your profile is active again.

**Can I order this for multiple locations?**
Yes. Multi-location businesses get a 15% discount on orders of 5+ locations. Each location receives its own fully customized optimization. [Browse Our Services](/services/) for multi-location pricing details.

## Complete the Stack

GBP optimization handles the map pack. These products handle the rest:

- **[SEO Audit](/services/seo-audit/)** ($297+) -- Diagnose your full SEO health, including GBP-to-website alignment
- **[Content Pages](/services/content-pages/)** ($97/page) -- Build the service and location pages that support your GBP rankings
- **[Schema Markup](/services/schema-markup/)** ($197+) -- Add LocalBusiness structured data that reinforces your GBP information
- **[Monthly Content](/services/monthly-content/)** ($297+/mo) -- Keep your site publishing consistently to build the topical authority that sustains map pack rankings

The businesses that dominate local search don't just optimize their GBP or their website. They do both. The signals reinforce each other.
