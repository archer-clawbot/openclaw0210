# Transparent Pricing. No Retainers Required.

## Content Page Volume Pricing

The more pages you order, the less each one costs.

| Quantity | Price Per Page | Example |
|---|---|---|
| 1-9 pages | $97 | 5 pages = $485 |
| 10-24 pages | $79 | 15 pages = $1,185 |

Volume pricing applies per order. Pages over 2,000 words are priced at 1.5x the standard rate.

## Managed SEO

Some businesses want a partner, not a product catalog. Our managed SEO service wraps the entire CATALYST system into a monthly engagement with a dedicated strategist.

**What's included:**
- Initial comprehensive audit and topical map
- Monthly content production (pages determined by your strategy)
- Ongoing GBP management and posting
- Schema implementation and maintenance
- Monthly reporting with geo-grid rankings, Share of Local Voice (SoLV), and Weighted Visibility Score (WVS)
- Quarterly strategy reviews
- Priority support

**Pricing:** Managed SEO starts at $1,500/month. Pricing depends on your market size, competition level, and scope.

We don't publish managed pricing on the website because every engagement is scoped differently. But we'll give you a straight answer on the first call.

## How We're Different

| | LocalCatalyst | Traditional Agency | Freelancer |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Pricing** | Fixed per deliverable | $1,500-5,000/month retainer | $50-150/hour, scope creep |
| **Turnaround** | Hours to days | Weeks to months | Days to weeks |
| **Transparency** | You see exactly what you're paying for | Monthly reports you can't decipher | Depends on the freelancer |
| **Consistency** | AI system, same quality every time | Depends on who's assigned | Varies wildly |
| **Scalability** | Order 1 page or 100 pages | Locked into a retainer scope | Limited by hours |
| **Commitment** | None. Buy what you need. | 3-12 month contracts | Project-based, but scope creep |

We're not saying agencies and freelancers are bad. We're saying you shouldn't need a long-term commitment to get an SEO audit or 20 content pages. Buy what you need. Come back when you need more.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I start with just one product?**
Yes. There's no minimum order and no required bundle. Most customers start with either a topical map or an SEO audit, then order additional products based on what they learn. But you can start with a single content page if that's what you need.

**How is this so fast?**
Our system uses 18 specialized AI agents that work in parallel. A task that takes a human SEO specialist 2-3 weeks (like building a topical map) takes our system 4-6 hours because the research, clustering, keyword analysis, and mapping all happen simultaneously. There's no queue, no project manager overhead, and no context-switching between clients.

**Is the quality as good as a human SEO specialist?**
In most cases, it's more consistent. A senior SEO specialist might produce a better topical map on their best day. But they might also produce a mediocre one when they're rushed, distracted, or juggling five other clients. Our system produces the same quality every time, following the same methodology, checking the same data sources, and applying the same optimization standards. The output has been validated against work from SEO professionals with 10+ years of experience.

**What if I'm not happy with a deliverable?**
Every product includes one revision round at no extra cost. If the deliverable doesn't meet the specifications outlined on the product page, we'll redo it. We don't offer refunds on completed work, but we've never had to redo an order twice.

**Do you offer white-label services for agencies?**
Yes. Every deliverable is unbranded by default. You can present it to your clients as your own work. Agencies and freelancers use our products to scale their delivery capacity without hiring more staff. Contact us for agency volume pricing.

**How do you compare to [other tool/agency]?**
We're not a tool -- you don't log in and run reports yourself. We're not a traditional agency -- you don't sign a contract and wait for monthly deliverables. We're a product. You order what you need, we deliver it, you use it. The closest comparison is a freelancer who's always available, always consistent, and always fast. Except we're cheaper and we don't take vacations.
