If you run a medical practice, your Google Business Profile is the single most important asset in your [local SEO strategy](/industries/medical-practices/). More than 70% of patients searching for a new doctor never scroll past the local pack — the three-listing map result that dominates the top of search results. Your GBP is your ticket into that space.

This guide covers the exact steps physicians and practice managers need to take to claim, optimize, and maintain a Google Business Profile that consistently drives new patient appointments.

## Why GBP Matters More for Doctors Than Almost Any Other Business

Medical practices operate in a unique competitive environment. Patients searching "primary care doctor near me" or "dermatologist in [city]" are high-intent searchers — they need a provider, often urgently. Google's local pack is the first thing they see, and the information displayed there (hours, reviews, photos, services) often determines whether they call your office or your competitor's.

Unlike e-commerce or national brands, your practice serves a defined geographic radius. GBP is built for exactly this use case. A fully optimized profile doesn't just improve visibility — it directly converts searchers into scheduled appointments.

At LocalCatalyst, we track this impact through Share of Local Voice (SoLV), which measures how often your practice appears in the local pack across all relevant keyword and location combinations in your service area. Most medical practices we audit have a SoLV below 15%, meaning they're invisible for 85% of the searches their ideal patients are running.

## Step 1: Claim and Verify Your Profile Correctly

If you haven't claimed your profile, start at [business.google.com](https://business.google.com). Search for your practice name. If a listing already exists (it likely does — Google creates them from public data), claim it. If not, create one.

**Verification methods for medical practices:**
- **Postcard verification** is the most common. Google mails a PIN to your office address. This takes 5-14 days.
- **Phone verification** is sometimes available for established practices. You'll receive an automated call with a code.
- **Video verification** may be required for newer practices. You'll record a short video of your office exterior, signage, and interior.

**Critical mistakes to avoid:**
- Do not create a second listing if one already exists. Duplicate listings split your review equity and confuse Google's algorithm.
- Use your real street address, not a P.O. box. Google will suspend listings that use mail drops.
- If you operate from a shared medical building, include your suite number.

## Step 2: Choose the Right Primary and Secondary Categories

Your primary category is the single strongest ranking signal in your GBP. Choose the most specific category that matches your practice type.

**Primary category examples by specialty:**
| Practice Type | Primary Category |
|---|---|
| Family medicine | Family practice physician |
| Internal medicine | Internist |
| Pediatrics | Pediatrician |
| Dermatology | Dermatologist |
| Orthopedics | Orthopedic surgeon |
| OB/GYN | Obstetrician-gynecologist |
| Cardiology | Cardiologist |

**Secondary categories** should cover additional services you offer. A family practice physician might add "Walk-in clinic," "Sports medicine clinic," or "Vaccination clinic" as secondaries. Add every category that legitimately applies — there's no penalty for using multiple categories, and each one unlocks additional search terms.

Do not select categories for services you don't offer. If you're a general practitioner, don't add "Dermatologist" just because you treat occasional skin conditions. Google uses categories to match searchers to providers, and mismatches lead to poor engagement signals that hurt your ranking.

## Step 3: Write a Business Description That Converts

You get 750 characters. Use them strategically.

**Structure that works:**
1. **First sentence:** State what you do and where. "LocalCatalyst Medical Group provides comprehensive family medicine for patients across [City] and [Neighboring City]."
2. **Middle section:** Mention specific services, conditions treated, or differentiators. "Our physicians specialize in chronic disease management, preventive care, and same-day urgent appointments."
3. **Final sentence:** Include a soft call to action. "New patients are welcome — schedule your first visit today."

**What to avoid:**
- Links (Google strips them)
- Promotional language like "best doctor in town"
- Keyword stuffing — write for patients, not algorithms

## Step 4: Upload Strategic Photos

Practices with 20+ photos receive 2x more direction requests than those with fewer than 5. But quantity without quality hurts you.

**Photo strategy for medical practices:**
- **Exterior shots:** Front of building with visible signage, parking area, building entrance. Upload at least 3 from different angles. These help Google confirm your location and help patients find you.
- **Interior shots:** Waiting room, exam rooms (empty, HIPAA-safe), front desk area. Patients want to see a clean, modern environment before they visit.
- **Team photos:** Physicians in professional attire, staff group photo. Patients choosing a new doctor want to see who they'll be meeting.
- **Equipment photos:** If you have specialized equipment (ultrasound, X-ray, lab), photograph it. This signals capability and investment.

Upload new photos at least monthly. Google favors profiles with recent visual content. A simple strategy: take one photo per week on the same day and upload it the following Monday.

## Step 5: Use Google Posts to Signal Activity

Google Posts appear directly on your profile and in discovery searches. Medical practices underuse this feature massively — fewer than 10% of practices post regularly.

**Effective post types for doctors:**
- **Health awareness posts** tied to monthly observances (Heart Health Month in February, Breast Cancer Awareness in October)
- **New service announcements** ("Now accepting same-day telehealth appointments")
- **Provider introductions** when new physicians join
- **Seasonal health tips** ("Flu season is here — walk-in flu shots available Monday through Friday")

Post at least once per week. Each post expires after 7 days, so consistency matters. Include a photo and a CTA button ("Book online," "Call now," or "Learn more" linking to a relevant page on your website).

## Step 6: Manage Services and Attributes

Google lets you list specific services within your profile. For medical practices, this is where you enumerate the conditions and treatments you handle. Add every service you offer — the more specific, the better.

**Attributes to enable:**
- Online appointments (if you offer them — this is a major differentiator)
- Telehealth visits
- Wheelchair accessible
- Languages spoken (add every language your staff can communicate in)
- LGBTQ+ friendly (if applicable)

These attributes appear as filters in Google's search interface. Patients actively filter by "online appointments" and "accepts new patients," so missing these attributes means missing those searchers entirely.

## Step 7: Build and Respond to Reviews

Reviews are covered in depth in our [patient review management](/industries/medical-practices/) guide, but the GBP-specific points matter here.

**For GBP ranking purposes:**
- Review velocity (how frequently you receive new reviews) matters more than total count
- Reviews containing keywords ("great dermatologist," "best pediatrician in [city]") boost rankings for those terms
- Owner responses to reviews signal engagement to Google's algorithm — respond to every review within 48 hours

Your [Google Business Profile management](/services/gbp-optimization/) strategy should integrate review generation as a core weekly activity, not an afterthought.

## Step 8: Track Performance With the Right Metrics

GBP Insights provides basic data, but it doesn't tell you the full story. The metrics that actually matter:

- **Search queries:** What terms are people using to find your profile? This reveals keyword opportunities.
- **Direction requests by zip code:** This shows your actual service area reach and where you're weak.
- **Phone call timing:** When do most calls come in? Staff accordingly.
- **Photo views vs. competitors:** Google tells you how your photo engagement compares to similar businesses. If you're below average, your visual content needs work.

For deeper tracking, LocalCatalyst uses geo-grid analysis to map your visibility across every point in your service area, broken down by keyword. This reveals the specific neighborhoods and search terms where your GBP is underperforming — data that basic Insights can't provide.

## FAQ

### How long does it take for GBP optimization to show results?
Most medical practices see measurable changes in local pack visibility within 4-8 weeks of comprehensive optimization. Category changes and description updates can impact rankings within days. Review velocity improvements compound over 2-3 months. The fastest wins typically come from correcting category mismatches and adding missing attributes.

### Can multiple doctors in the same practice have individual GBP listings?
Yes, but only if each doctor operates as a distinct practitioner at the same address. Google allows "practitioner" listings for individual physicians within a group practice. Each practitioner listing should use the doctor's name (not the practice name) and their specific specialty as the primary category. The practice itself maintains its own separate listing.

### Should I use a tracking phone number on my GBP?
Use your primary office phone number as the primary number on your GBP. If you need call tracking, add the tracking number as a secondary number. Swapping your primary number for a tracking number can cause verification issues and confuse Google's algorithm about your business identity. NAP (Name, Address, Phone) consistency across the web remains a ranking factor.
