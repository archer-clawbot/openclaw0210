`The Local SEO Agency That Gets You Found and Gets You Customers`

## Intro Content

When someone in your city searches for what you do, you need to be at the top of Google. Not page two. Not buried under national chains. At the top — in the Map Pack, in the local results, impossible to miss.

That's what LocalCatalyst does. We're a local SEO agency built specifically for small businesses that serve a local market. We don't waste time on vanity metrics or "brand awareness." We focus on one thing: getting you ranking in your city so local customers call you, not your competitors.

If you're a plumber in Chicago, a dentist in Dallas, a restaurant in Miami, or any business that depends on local customers — LocalCatalyst is the agency you hire when you're serious about dominating local search.

## What Makes LocalCatalyst Different

### H2
`Why LocalCatalyst Is Different from Other SEO Agencies`

Most SEO agencies treat local businesses like an afterthought. They use the same generic playbook they use for e-commerce or national brands. They talk about "domain authority" and "backlink profiles" when what you really need is to rank in the Map Pack.

LocalCatalyst is different. We **only** do local SEO. We've built our entire methodology around one goal: making local businesses visible in local search.

**1. We Specialize in Local SEO (Not Generic SEO)**

We don't do e-commerce SEO. We don't do enterprise consulting. We don't optimize Amazon listings or app store pages. We do one thing exceptionally well: local SEO for businesses that serve a specific geographic area.

When you work with us, you're not working with a generalist who dabbles in local SEO. You're working with specialists who live and breathe Google Business Profiles, Map Pack rankings, and local search algorithms.

**2. We Have a Proven Methodology (The CATALYST Framework)**

LocalCatalyst operates on the **CATALYST Local SEO Framework**, a proprietary system we've refined over hundreds of client campaigns:

- **A — Audit:** Deep-dive analysis of your current local presence, GBP, citations, and competitive landscape
- **P — Position:** Strategic positioning of your business in Google's local ecosystem (categories, service areas, NAP consistency)
- **E — Engage:** Active management of your GBP (posts, photos, reviews, Q&A)
- **X — Expand:** Content creation, link building, and ongoing optimization to expand your local footprint

This isn't a generic SEO checklist. It's a battle-tested framework for local search domination.

**3. We Focus on the Metrics That Matter**

We don't send you reports filled with "impressions" and "engagement." We track what actually drives revenue:

- **Map Pack rankings** (position 1-3 for your top keywords)
- **Phone calls** (tracked via call tracking)
- **Direction requests** (from Google Business Profile)
- **Form submissions** (lead capture on your website)
- **Customer acquisition cost** (how much you're paying per lead vs. what they're worth)

If a tactic doesn't move these numbers, we don't waste your budget on it.

**4. We Manage Your Google Business Profile Like It's Our Own**

Your GBP is the single most important asset you have for local search. We treat it like mission-critical infrastructure. Weekly posts. Fresh photos. Review responses within 24 hours. Q&A management. Attribute optimization. Service area tuning.

Most agencies "set it and forget it." We actively manage your GBP like a living, breathing marketing channel — because that's what it is.

**5. We Build Technical SEO into Local SEO**

Local SEO isn't just about citations and reviews. Google's algorithm looks at your website's technical health: page speed, mobile optimization, schema markup, Core Web Vitals, crawl efficiency.

LocalCatalyst doesn't treat technical SEO as a separate service. We bake it into every local SEO campaign because a slow, broken website kills your rankings no matter how good your GBP is.
