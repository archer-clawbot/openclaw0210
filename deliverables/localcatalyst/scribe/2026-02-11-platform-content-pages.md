## The Difference Between Content and Content That Ranks

You can write a page about "emergency plumber in Dallas." So can anyone. What separates a page that sits on page 4 from a page that ranks in the top 3?

Structure. Keyword targeting. Header hierarchy. Internal linking. Content depth. FAQ coverage. Schema-ready formatting. Title tag and meta description optimization.

None of this is creative writing. It's engineering. And it's exactly what our AI content system is built to do -- consistently, at scale, in hours instead of weeks.

### Before: A Typical Service Page
> **Emergency Plumber Dallas**
> We are the best emergency plumbers in Dallas. Call us today for all your plumbing needs. We offer 24/7 service and competitive pricing. Contact us now!
>
> *65 words. No headers. No keywords beyond the title. No internal links. No FAQ. No schema. Google has nothing to work with.*

### After: A LocalCatalyst Content Page
> **H1:** Emergency Plumber in Dallas -- 24/7 Same-Day Service
> 1,200+ words covering common emergencies, response time expectations, service area, pricing transparency, what to do while waiting, related services (with internal links), structured FAQ section with 5 questions, schema-ready markup, optimized title tag and meta description.
>
> *Google sees topical depth, clear intent targeting, and structured data it can use for rich results.*

That's the difference. And it takes our system 2-4 hours to produce.

## Volume Pricing

| Quantity | Price Per Page | Example Total |
|---|---|---|
| 1-9 pages | $97/page | 5 pages = $485 |
| 10-24 pages | $79/page | 15 pages = $1,185 |
| 25-49 pages | $69/page | 30 pages = $2,070 |
| 50+ pages | $59/page | 50 pages = $2,950 |

Pages over 2,000 words are priced at 1.5x the standard rate.

Pricing applies to a single order. The more pages you order at once, the lower the per-page cost.

**The smart play:** Order a [topical map](/services/topical-map/) first ($397). It tells you exactly which pages to build. A typical topical map identifies 30-50 content opportunities. At 30 pages and the 25+ rate, your total is $397 + $2,070 = **$2,467** for a complete content strategy and execution. That's less than one month of most agency retainers.

## What's Included Per Page

Every content page you order includes:

- **Fully optimized copy** (800-1,500 words, adjustable to your preference)
- **H1, H2, H3 header hierarchy** targeting primary and secondary keywords
- **Title tag** (under 60 characters, keyword-optimized)
- **Meta description** (under 160 characters, click-optimized)
- **Internal linking suggestions** based on your site's existing and planned content
- **FAQ section** with 3-5 questions relevant to the page topic (ready for FAQ schema)
- **Schema-ready structure** so you can add structured data directly
- **Downloadable formats:** Markdown, HTML, and plain text

Every page is written for a specific keyword, with a specific search intent, using a structure that Google can parse and rank.

## Bulk Order Flow

Ordering 10+ pages? Here's how it works:

1. **Upload your keyword list** -- A spreadsheet with target keywords, one per row. Add optional columns for word count, content type, and notes.
2. **We confirm details** -- You'll get a confirmation within 1 hour showing the pages we'll create, target keywords, and estimated delivery time.
3. **Batched delivery** -- Pages are delivered in batches of 5-10 as they're completed. A 30-page order typically delivers fully within 48-72 hours.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Can I request revisions?**
Yes. Each page includes one round of revisions at no additional cost. Revision requests must be submitted within 7 days of delivery.

**What if I need a specific word count?**
Default is 800-1,500 words per page, which is the range that performs best for most local service pages. You can specify a higher word count at order time. Pages over 2,000 words are priced at 1.5x the standard rate.

**Do I get to set the tone and style?**
Yes. You can provide tone guidelines, sample pages from your site, or a brand voice document. If you don't provide any, we default to professional, direct, and conversion-focused.

**Are these AI-generated? Will Google penalize me?**
The content is generated by our AI system and reviewed for quality. Google does not penalize AI-generated content. Google penalizes low-quality content, regardless of who or what created it. Our content is structured, optimized, and substantive -- the factors Google actually evaluates.

**Can I order content in languages other than English?**
Currently we support English only. Spanish content is coming soon.
