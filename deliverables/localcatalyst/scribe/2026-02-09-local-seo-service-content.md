## SECTION 1: WHAT IS LOCAL SEO?

### H2
What Is Local SEO and Why Does Your Business Need It?

Local SEO is the process of optimizing your online presence to rank higher in local search results — specifically the **Google Map Pack**, the 3-business showcase that appears when someone searches for services near them.

When a potential customer searches "plumber near me" or "dentist in Chicago," Google displays the Map Pack above all other results. If you're not in that pack, you're invisible to 75% of local searchers who never scroll past it.

#### Why Local SEO Matters

**46% of all Google searches have local intent.** Every day, millions of people search for businesses exactly like yours in their area. The question is: are they finding you or your competitors?

**The data is clear:**
- **76% of people** who search for something nearby visit a business within 24 hours
- **28% of local searches** result in a purchase
- **88% of consumers** who do a local search on their smartphone visit or call a business within 24 hours

**If you're not in the Map Pack, you're losing customers to competitors who are.**

#### What Makes Local SEO Different from National SEO

**National SEO** targets broad keywords without geographic modifiers:
- "running shoes"
- "personal injury lawyer"
- "HVAC repair"

**Local SEO** targets geo-specific queries with local intent:
- "running shoes near me"
- "personal injury lawyer Chicago"
- "emergency HVAC repair Lincoln Park"

Local SEO requires:
- Google Business Profile optimization
- Local citations (NAP consistency across directories)
- Geo-targeted content (location pages, city-specific blog posts)
- Location-specific schema markup
- Review generation and management
- Geo-grid rank tracking (not just single-point rankings)

**The bottom line:** Generic SEO agencies treat local search like national search and fail. We specialize exclusively in local — and we dominate.

## SECTION 2: WHAT'S INCLUDED

### H2
What's Included in Our Local SEO Services

Our local SEO service is comprehensive — we optimize every signal Google uses to rank local businesses.

---

### 1. Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization

Your Google Business Profile is the #1 ranking factor for Map Pack visibility. Most businesses claim their profile and stop. We engineer it as a conversion-optimized micro-website.

#### What We Do:
- **Complete GBP audit** across our 5-SPEC framework
- **Custom service entries** engineered as micro-landing pages targeting long-tail keywords
- **750-character description** with Local Hub Gambit entity co-citation framework
- **Strategic Q&A seeding** (10-15 pre-emptive questions with keyword-dense answers)
- **Products tab optimization** for conversion (service packages as "products")
- **3x/week posting cadence** with AI Overview seeding
- **Photo & video optimization** (minimum 20 high-quality images, geotagged when possible)
- **Attribute optimization** (all relevant attributes selected and updated seasonally)

#### Why It Matters:
Your GBP is prime real estate. Every field — from your description to your Q&A to your service entries — is indexed by Google and influences rankings. We don't waste a single character.

**[Learn more about our GBP Optimization service →](/services/google-business-profile-optimization/)**

---

### 2. Citation Building & NAP Consistency

Citations are online mentions of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP). Google uses citations as trust signals — the more authoritative directories listing your business consistently, the more Google trusts you.

#### What We Do:
- **Audit existing citations** for NAP inconsistencies across 100+ directories
- **Submit to 50-100+ high-authority directories:** Yelp, BBB, Apple Maps, Bing Places, Yellow Pages, industry-specific directories
- **Fix duplicate or incorrect listings** that dilute ranking signals
- **Data aggregator submissions** (Neustar, Factual, Acxiom) to push accurate data to hundreds of downstream directories
- **Ongoing citation monitoring** to catch and fix inconsistencies

#### Why It Matters:
Inconsistent NAP data (different phone numbers, misspelled addresses, old business names) confuses Google and dilutes your ranking signals. We audit, fix, and maintain consistency across the entire web.

**Target:** 50+ citations (Starter), 60+ (Growth), 100+ (Domination)

---

### 3. Review Generation & Management

Google factors review quantity, recency, velocity, and sentiment into Map Pack rankings. Businesses with 50+ reviews and 4.5+ stars dominate competitors with fewer or older reviews.

#### What We Do:
- **Automated review request campaigns** (email/SMS triggered after purchase or service completion)
- **Custom review landing pages** that guide customers to your GBP review form
- **Review response protocol:** We respond to ALL reviews within 24 hours (positive and negative)
- **Sentiment monitoring** and reputation management
- **Negative review mitigation strategy** (resolution tactics, suppression through new positive reviews)

#### Why It Matters:
Reviews are social proof AND a ranking factor. Customers trust businesses with many recent reviews. Google rewards them with higher Map Pack positions.

**Target Metrics:**
- 50+ reviews within 6 months
- 4.5+ star average
- Consistent velocity (5-10 new reviews per month)
- 100% response rate

---

### 4. Geo-Grid Rank Tracking

Most agencies track rankings from one location (usually your business address). That's useless if your service area spans multiple neighborhoods or cities.

#### What We Do:
- **Weekly geo-grid scans** across dozens of points in your service area
- **SoLV (Share of Local Voice) scoring:** Your % of total Map Pack appearances vs. competitors
- **WVS (Weighted Visibility Score):** Position-weighted ranking quality (position #1 = more weight than #3)
- **Heat maps** showing where you rank across your service area
- **Trend analysis** and competitive displacement monitoring (when you overtake a competitor)

#### Why It Matters:
A single ranking from your office address doesn't reflect customer reality. Customers search from all over your service area. Geo-grid tracking shows your TRUE market coverage — the metric that correlates with revenue.

**Example:**
Instead of "you rank #3 for 'plumber Chicago,'" we show:
- Lincoln Park: #1 (up from #7)
- Lakeview: #2 (up from #9)
- Wicker Park: #1 (up from not ranking)
- Loop: #4 (up from #12)
- **SoLV: 38%** (you appear in 38% of all Map Pack results across target areas)

---

### 5. Location-Based Content Strategy

Your website needs to prove to Google that you serve specific areas. Generic "we serve Chicago" pages don't work — you need deep, structured content demonstrating local expertise.

#### What We Do:
- **Semantic location silos:** City hub pages with neighborhood spoke pages
- **Grounding boxes** optimized for AI Overviews (snippet-format content blocks answering common local queries)
- **Internal linking architecture** for topical authority (hub-and-spoke linking model)
- **Geo-targeted blog content** (neighborhood guides, local event coverage, area-specific tips)

#### Content Structure Example:
```
/services/plumbing-chicago/ (city hub)
├── /services/plumbing-lincoln-park/ (neighborhood spoke)
├── /services/plumbing-lakeview/ (neighborhood spoke)
└── /services/plumbing-wicker-park/ (neighborhood spoke)
```

Each page:
- 800-1,500 words of unique, location-specific content
- Mentions local landmarks, businesses, neighborhoods (entity co-citations)
- Includes service-specific schema with geo-coordinates
- Links back to main service pages and related blog content

#### Why It Matters:
Location silos signal geographic relevance and service area coverage. Google sees you as the local authority because your content demonstrates deep market knowledge.

---

### 6. Local Link Building

Local backlinks from authoritative local sources signal to Google that you're embedded in the community.

#### What We Do:
- **Local business partnerships** and co-marketing opportunities (link exchanges with complementary businesses)
- **Chamber of Commerce & local association links** (memberships that include directory listings)
- **Local news and PR placements** (press releases, expert quotes, story angles)
- **Sponsorships and event link opportunities** (local sports teams, charity events, community organizations)
- **Geo-specific directory submissions** (neighborhood associations, local blogs, city-specific resources)

#### Why It Matters:
Links from local .gov sites, news outlets, .edu domains, and community organizations carry more weight for local rankings than generic national directories.

**Target:** 5+ local links per month (Domination package)

---

### 7. Schema Markup for Local Businesses

Schema is structured data that helps Google understand your business, services, and location. It's the language search engines speak.

#### What We Do:
- **LocalBusiness schema** with complete NAP, hours, geo-coordinates
- **Service schema** for each service offering
- **Review schema** (aggregate ratings displayed in search results)
- **FAQ schema** for common questions (featured snippet opportunities)
- **BreadcrumbList schema** for site navigation
- **Multi-location schema** (if applicable)

#### Why It Matters:
Properly implemented schema increases chances of rich results (star ratings, business hours, Q&A) and enhances AI Overview visibility. It's the difference between Google "guessing" what you do and you "telling" Google exactly what you do.

---

## SECTION 4: WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT

### H2
Why LocalCatalyst Local SEO Gets Results

---

### 1. We Track What Matters: SoLV (Share of Local Voice)

Most agencies report "keyword rankings" from one location. That's meaningless.

**We track geo-grid visibility** across dozens of points in your service area and calculate your **Share of Local Voice** — your percentage of total Map Pack appearances vs. competitors.

**Why SoLV matters:**
- It's the metric that correlates with customer acquisition
- It shows TRUE market coverage, not just rankings from your office
- It reveals competitive displacement (when you steal share from competitors)

**Example Report:**
- Your SoLV: 38% (up from 12% baseline)
- Competitor A: 24% (down from 31%)
- Competitor B: 19% (down from 22%)
- **Result:** You're now the dominant player capturing the majority of local searches

---

### 2. We Optimize for AI, Not Just Google

In 2026, customers find businesses through:
- Google Search & Maps (still #1)
- ChatGPT local recommendations
- Perplexity local queries
- Gemini voice search
- Siri/Alexa local business requests

We optimize for **all of them** using our LLM SEO methodology.

**How we do it:**
- **Entity co-citation framework:** Mention related local entities Google and LLMs associate with your business
- **Grounding boxes:** Snippet-optimized content blocks designed for AI citation
- **Q&A seeding:** Address common queries in formats AI engines prefer (direct answers, structured data)
- **Review sentiment optimization:** Positive reviews mentioning specific services and benefits

**The result:** When someone asks ChatGPT "best plumber in Chicago," you're recommended.

---

### 3. We Don't Just Build Citations — We Engineer GBP Domination

Most agencies:
- Submit your business to 20-30 directories
- Upload a few photos to GBP
- Ask for reviews
- Post occasionally
- Call it done

**We:**
- Treat your GBP as a conversion-optimized micro-website
- Engineer every field for ranking AND conversion
- Create custom service entries targeting long-tail keywords
- Pre-seed Q&A to control the narrative
- Post 3x/week with AI Overview targeting
- Monitor competitors and displace them systematically

**[Learn more about our GBP Optimization →](/services/google-business-profile-optimization/)**

### 4. Transparent, Data-Driven Reporting

No black-box dashboards. No vanity metrics. No hiding behind "it takes time."

**You get:**
- **Weekly pulse reports:** Review activity, post performance, quick wins
- **Monthly deep-dive reports:** SoLV, WVS, geo-grid heat maps, traffic, conversions, ROI
- **Quarterly strategy calls:** Review performance, adjust tactics, plan next 90 days
- **Real-time access** to rank tracking dashboards

**We report what matters:** Direction requests, phone calls, form submissions, revenue — not just "keyword rankings."

## SECTION 7: FAQ

### H2
Local SEO Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does local SEO take to see results?**

A: Quick wins (GBP optimization, critical citation fixes) can show movement within 2-4 weeks. Significant Map Pack ranking improvements typically occur within 8-12 weeks. Full market domination (50%+ SoLV) takes 3-6 months depending on competition level and starting point.

The timeline depends on:
- Current state of your GBP and citations
- Competitive intensity of your market
- Number of target keywords
- Review velocity

We typically see measurable improvements within the first month, with compound growth accelerating through months 2-6.

---

**Q: Do you guarantee #1 rankings?**

A: We don't guarantee specific rankings (no ethical agency does — Google controls the algorithm, not us). However, we **do guarantee** measurable improvement in your SoLV (Share of Local Voice) within 90 days or we continue working at no cost until we deliver results.

Our track record: 95% of clients achieve top-3 Map Pack rankings for their primary keywords within 12 weeks.

---

**Q: What if I don't have a physical location?**

A: Service-area businesses (SABs) can absolutely dominate local search. We optimize your GBP as a SAB (hiding your address, showing your service area) and build geo-specific content to establish service area authority.

Examples: Plumbers, electricians, mobile auto repair, in-home services, contractors.

The strategy is slightly different (more emphasis on content and reviews since you don't have a physical location signal), but equally effective.

---

**Q: How is local SEO different from regular SEO?**

A: Local SEO prioritizes:
- **Map Pack rankings** (the 3-pack at the top of search results)
- **GBP optimization** (your Google Business Profile is the #1 ranking factor)
- **Local citations** (directory listings with NAP consistency)
- **Geo-targeted content** (location pages proving service area coverage)
- **Review generation** (social proof + ranking factor)

Regular (national) SEO focuses on:
- Organic rankings for broad keywords without location modifiers
- Domain authority and backlink building
- Content depth for informational queries
- Less emphasis on GBP (since there's no local intent)

**Local SEO is a specialized skill set.** Generic SEO agencies who "also do local" typically fail because they don't understand the nuances.

---

**Q: Can I do local SEO myself?**

A: You can handle basics:
- Claim your GBP
- Ask customers for reviews
- Submit to a few directories

But advanced tactics require specialized tools, expertise, and time:
- Geo-grid optimization across dozens of tracking points
- Entity co-citation engineering in your GBP description
- Schema markup implementation
- Citation consistency across 100+ directories
- AI Overview positioning
- Competitive displacement strategies

**ROI calculation:** If your average customer is worth $500 and local SEO generates 20 new customers per month, that's $10,000/month in revenue. Our $2,500/month fee pays for itself 4x over.

---

**Q: What industries do you work with?**

A: We specialize in service-based local businesses:

**Home Services:**
- HVAC
- Plumbing
- Electrical
- Roofing
- Landscaping

**Professional Services:**
- Law firms
- Accounting
- Medical/dental practices
- Real estate agents
- Insurance agencies

**Retail & Hospitality:**
- Restaurants
- Auto repair
- Retail stores
- Gyms/fitness studios

**What we DON'T do:** E-commerce (national), SaaS, purely online businesses without local service areas.

---

**Q: What happens if I stop working with you?**

A: You own everything we build:
- Your GBP optimization stays
- Citations remain live (directories don't delete listings)
- Content we create stays on your site
- Schema markup remains implemented

What stops:
- Ongoing GBP posting (you'll need to take over or hire someone else)
- Review response (you'll handle this yourself)
- Monthly reporting and rank tracking
- Competitive monitoring and strategy adjustments

**No lock-in contracts.** Month-to-month agreements (though we recommend 6-month minimum for meaningful results).
