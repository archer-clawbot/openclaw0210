## Turning Dead Links Into Live Backlinks

Every day, websites go offline. Businesses close. Pages get deleted. URLs change without redirects. The result is millions of broken links scattered across the web — links that once pointed to useful content but now lead to 404 error pages. Broken link building turns this problem into an opportunity: you find the broken links, create better replacement content, and pitch the site owner on updating their dead link to point to your resource instead.

This is one of the most effective and ethical strategies within our [link building services](/link-building-services/) because it solves a real problem for the site owner. Nobody wants broken links on their website. They degrade user experience, waste crawl budget, and signal poor maintenance to search engines. When you offer a replacement that is better than what the original link pointed to, you are doing the site owner a favor — and earning a backlink in the process.

## How Broken Link Building Works

The process follows a clear sequence: find broken links on relevant sites, create or identify replacement content, and reach out to the site owner with a fix.

### Step 1: Find Broken Links on Relevant Sites

There are three primary methods for discovering broken link opportunities:

**Competitor backlink analysis.** When a website that once linked to your competitor goes offline or removes the page, that link becomes a broken link on the referring site. Tools like Ahrefs and Semrush allow you to filter competitor backlink profiles for links pointing to 404 pages. Every broken competitor link is a potential opportunity for you.

**Resource page scanning.** Resource pages — curated lists of links on a topic — are particularly prone to link rot because they contain dozens or hundreds of outbound links that degrade over time. We scan resource pages in your industry using browser extensions like Check My Links (which highlights broken links on any page in real time) and Screaming Frog (which crawls entire sites and flags broken outbound links at scale).

**Industry-wide broken link prospecting.** Using Ahrefs' Content Explorer or similar tools, we search for pages in your industry that have earned significant backlinks but are now offline (returning 404 or 410 status codes). Every site that linked to that dead page is a prospect. If the dead page had 50 referring domains, that is 50 potential outreach targets.

### Step 2: Create Replacement Content That Exceeds the Original

The replacement content is what makes or breaks the pitch. Site owners will not swap a broken link for your homepage or a thin service page. They will swap it for a resource that is equal to or better than what the original link pointed to.

This is where broken link building separates the amateurs from the strategists:

- **Research the original content** using the Wayback Machine (web.archive.org) to see exactly what the dead page contained
- **Create a replacement that covers everything the original did** — plus additional value, updated information, and better formatting
- **Make the replacement genuinely useful** to the linking site's audience, not a thinly disguised sales page
- **Match the format** — if the original was a guide, create a guide; if it was a tool, create a tool

The content you create for broken link building also serves your [content strategy](/seo-content-strategy/) — these assets rank in their own right and continue attracting links long after the initial outreach campaign ends.

### Step 3: Pitch the Site Owner

The outreach email for broken link building has a natural advantage over most link requests: you are helping the site owner fix a problem, not asking for a favor.

**Effective outreach structure:**

1. **Identify the specific broken link** — Tell them exactly which page has the dead link (URL of their page) and which link is broken (the dead URL)
2. **Explain why it matters** — Broken links hurt user experience and SEO signals
3. **Offer your replacement** — Present your content as a ready-made fix, with a direct link they can evaluate
4. **Keep it brief** — Site owners appreciate conciseness; 4-6 sentences is ideal

**What not to do:**

- Do not send vague emails that say "I found some broken links on your site" without specifics
- Do not pitch irrelevant replacements — your content must actually cover the topic the broken link addressed
- Do not make it about you; make it about fixing their page
- Do not follow up more than twice; respect the lack of response

## Success Rates and Scaling

Broken link building has higher response rates than most outreach-based link building strategies because you are offering value rather than requesting it:

- **Response rate:** 10-20% (compared to 5-10% for cold outreach)
- **Conversion rate:** 5-12% of outreach emails result in a link placement
- **Timeline:** Typical turnaround of 2-4 weeks from outreach to live link

Scaling requires systematic prospecting. We maintain running lists of broken link opportunities in every client's industry, updated monthly as new links break and new opportunities emerge. The prospecting compounds — once you have created a high-quality replacement asset, every new broken link in that topic area is another outreach opportunity for the same content.

## Broken Link Building for Local Businesses

Local businesses have a distinct set of broken link opportunities that national competitors cannot access:

### Local Community Pages With Dead Links

Local chambers of commerce, community organizations, city government sites, and school district pages frequently contain broken outbound links. These organizations update their websites infrequently, and links to local businesses that have closed, moved, or changed URLs pile up. A local business that can offer a relevant replacement earns a link from a high-authority local domain — the most valuable type of backlink for [local link building](/link-building-services/local-link-building/).

### Defunct Local Business Links

When a local business closes, every site that linked to it now has a broken link. If a competing dental practice that had earned links from local media, community organizations, and business directories shuts down, those broken links are opportunities. Your replacement content — a comprehensive guide, local resource, or community-focused page — can fill the gap.

### Regional Resource Pages

State and regional organizations maintain resource pages that accumulate broken links over time. State contractor boards, regional healthcare directories, and area-specific business guides all contain dead links that local businesses can replace with their own high-quality content. These carry both the authority signal of an institutional link and the geographic relevance that strengthens local rankings.

The geographic specificity of these opportunities means less competition for each placement compared to national broken link campaigns, where dozens of agencies may target the same opportunity simultaneously. This is one of the many advantages of an integrated approach that pairs broken link building with [resource page link building](/link-building-services/resource-link-building/) and [guest posting](/link-building-services/guest-posting/).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many broken link building opportunities exist in a typical local market?

More than most businesses expect. In a mid-size metro area, we typically identify 50-200+ broken link opportunities across local government, community, educational, and industry resource pages within the first prospecting cycle. The number grows as we expand into regional and national industry resources.

### Does Google treat broken link building differently from other link building?

No. Google evaluates the link itself — its placement, context, and the authority of the linking site. A link earned through broken link building is indistinguishable from any other editorially placed link. The method of acquisition does not affect the link's value; what matters is that the link is contextually relevant and editorially placed on a quality page.

### How long do replacement assets take to create?

Depending on the format and depth, 3-10 hours per asset. A comprehensive guide replacing a detailed but outdated resource page requires thorough research and professional writing. A simple checklist or reference page can be created more quickly. We typically create 2-3 replacement assets per month per client, each designed to serve multiple outreach campaigns.

### Can broken link building work alongside other link building strategies?

Absolutely — and it should. Broken link building is most powerful as one component of a diversified [link building strategy](/link-building-services/). The replacement content you create for broken link outreach also serves as linkable assets for resource page outreach, and the relationships you build with site owners during broken link campaigns can lead to [guest posting](/link-building-services/guest-posting/) and digital PR opportunities.
