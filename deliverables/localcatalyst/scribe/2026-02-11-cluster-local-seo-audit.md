## A Local SEO Audit Is Not a Generic SEO Audit

Most SEO audits are built for e-commerce or national brands — they analyze site speed, backlinks, and on-page factors that matter for organic rankings but miss the signals that actually determine local visibility. A local SEO audit is fundamentally different because local search is fundamentally different. As a specialized component of our comprehensive [SEO audit services](/seo-audit-services/), our local SEO audit examines every factor that determines whether your business appears in the Map Pack, local organic results, and AI-generated local recommendations.

Google uses a distinct set of ranking factors for local results: proximity, relevance, and prominence. These are evaluated through signals that a standard audit does not touch — your Google Business Profile completeness, citation consistency across 50+ directories, review velocity and sentiment, geo-grid ranking patterns, and the local schema markup on your website.

If you have been paying for "SEO services" that only analyze your website, you have been operating with an incomplete picture. The website is one piece. The local ecosystem is the whole puzzle.

**[Order Your SEO Audit](/services/seo-audit/)** and see the difference between a generic report and a local-specific analysis that actually shows you where your Map Pack visibility stands.

## Google Business Profile Audit: The 50-Point Checklist

Your Google Business Profile is the most important local ranking asset your business owns. For Map Pack queries — "plumber near me," "dentist in Scottsdale," "HVAC repair Phoenix" — GBP signals are the single most influential ranking factor.

Our GBP audit evaluates 50 optimization points organized across eight categories:

### Basic Information (10 points)

- **Business name:** Matches legal name exactly (no keyword stuffing in the name field — a practice that violates Google's guidelines and risks suspension)
- **Address:** Complete, accurate, and matches your website and all citations exactly
- **Phone number:** Primary local number (not toll-free), matching your website header
- **Website URL:** Points to the correct landing page (homepage for single-location, location page for multi-location)
- **Hours of operation:** Complete, accurate, including special hours and holiday schedules
- **Business description:** Full 750 characters utilized, naturally incorporating primary keywords and services
- **Opening date:** Set correctly (longer-established businesses receive a small ranking boost)
- **Service area:** Configured correctly for service-area businesses
- **Short name:** Claimed and configured for easy sharing
- **Verification status:** Verified through Google's official process

### Categories (8 points)

Category selection is where most businesses leave the most ranking opportunity on the table. Our audit evaluates:

- **Primary category:** Is it the most relevant, most-searched category for your core service? Most businesses choose a category that is too broad or too narrow.
- **Secondary categories:** Up to 9 additional categories that capture adjacent services. A dental practice might need: Dentist (primary), Cosmetic Dentist, Pediatric Dentist, Emergency Dental Service, Dental Implants Provider, Teeth Whitening Service.
- **Category completeness:** Are there relevant categories you have not added?
- **Competitor comparison:** What categories are the businesses ranking above you using?

We audit against Google's full category taxonomy (4,000+ categories) and compare your selections to the top 5 ranking competitors in your market.

### Services and Products (6 points)

Google's Services and Products tabs provide additional ranking signals that most businesses either ignore or configure poorly:

- **Custom services:** Named and described using terms customers actually search for — not internal jargon
- **Service descriptions:** Detailed enough to provide keyword relevance, not so long that they become unreadable
- **Pricing (optional):** When competitive pricing is an advantage
- **Products tab:** Utilized for tangible products or packaged service offerings
- **Service categories:** Organized to match your website's service architecture

### Photos and Visual Content (6 points)

Google rewards GBP listings with active photo management — and penalizes listings with low visual content:

- **Photo quantity:** Minimum 25 business photos (top-performing listings average 100+)
- **Photo quality:** Professional, well-lit, relevant images — not stock photos
- **Photo categories:** Cover image, logo, interior, exterior, team, work/products, and atmosphere
- **Photo metadata:** Geotagged with your business location
- **Photo freshness:** New photos added regularly (monthly minimum)
- **Video content:** Short videos (30-60 seconds) of your business, team, or completed work

### Posts and Updates (5 points)

GBP posts signal activity and relevance:

- **Posting frequency:** Minimum weekly, ideally 2-3 times per week
- **Post types:** Updates, offers, events, and product posts — using all available formats
- **Post quality:** Include images, CTAs, and keyword-relevant descriptions
- **Post engagement:** Click-through rates and interaction signals
- **Consistency:** Posts maintained over time, not a burst followed by silence

### Q&A Section (5 points)

The Q&A section is a frequently overlooked ranking and conversion opportunity:

- **Seeded questions:** Have you proactively asked and answered the most common customer questions? Businesses can ask and answer their own questions — this is not against policy.
- **Question coverage:** Are the top 10-15 questions customers ask represented?
- **Answer quality:** Detailed, helpful answers that include relevant keywords naturally
- **Monitoring:** Are new questions from the public being answered promptly?
- **Competitor comparison:** What questions are appearing on competitor listings?

### Reviews (6 points)

Our review analysis within the GBP audit covers:

- **Total review count** vs. top competitors
- **Average rating** and 6-month trajectory
- **Review velocity** — current rate of new reviews vs. competitive benchmarks
- **Response rate** — percentage of reviews (positive and negative) with a business response
- **Response quality** — personalization, keyword inclusion, professionalism
- **Review content** — presence of service keywords and location mentions in review text

This section connects directly to our [reputation management services](/reputation-management-services/) — if the audit reveals review gaps, we have a proven system to close them.

### Attributes and Features (4 points)

Google surfaces business attributes in search results and Maps:

- **Service attributes** (free estimates, emergency service, same-day service)
- **Accessibility attributes** (wheelchair accessible, parking details)
- **Health and safety attributes** (updated for current requirements)
- **Payment methods** accepted
- **Booking and messaging** enabled and configured

Each GBP optimization point is scored, and the aggregate gives you a completeness percentage that we benchmark against your top competitors.

## Citation Audit: NAP Consistency Across 50+ Directories

Citations — mentions of your business Name, Address, and Phone number on directories and websites across the web — are a core local ranking signal. Inconsistent citation data confuses Google and erodes trust.

### What We Audit

We check your NAP data across 50+ directories and data sources:

**Data aggregators (the source):**
- Data Axle (formerly Infogroup)
- Localeze (Neustar)
- Foursquare

**Major directories:**
- Google Business Profile, Apple Maps, Bing Places
- Yelp, BBB, Yellow Pages, Superpages, Citysearch
- Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram

**Industry-specific directories:**
- Medical: Healthgrades, Vitals, ZocDoc, WebMD, RateMDs
- Legal: Avvo, FindLaw, Justia, Martindale-Hubbell
- Home services: Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Porch, Houzz
- Restaurants: TripAdvisor, DoorDash, Grubhub, OpenTable
- Automotive: RepairPal, Carfax, AutoMD
- Real estate: Zillow, Realtor.com, Trulia

### What We Flag

- **Wrong phone numbers:** Old numbers, toll-free vs. local, tracking numbers that were never updated
- **Old addresses:** Previous locations still listed on directories
- **Misspelled business names:** "Smith & Associates" vs. "Smith and Associates" vs. "Smith & Assoc."
- **Duplicate listings:** Multiple listings for the same location on the same directory
- **Missing listings:** High-authority directories where you have no presence at all
- **Inconsistent formatting:** "Suite 100" vs. "Ste 100" vs. "#100" — even small variations create trust erosion

Each inconsistency is documented with the specific directory, the incorrect data, and the correction needed. The output is a remediation plan prioritized by directory authority.

For businesses that need ongoing citation management, our [citation building services](/citation-building-services/) handle both cleanup and new citation development.

## Local Link Profile Analysis

Local backlinks — links from organizations, media outlets, and businesses in your geographic area — are a powerful local ranking signal that standard backlink audits often overlook.

We analyze:

- **Local link inventory:** Which local organizations, chambers of commerce, news outlets, sponsors, and partners link to your site?
- **Competitor local links:** What local links do your top competitors have that you do not?
- **Link quality:** Are your local links from authoritative, relevant sources or from low-value directories?
- **Anchor text distribution:** Natural and varied, or over-optimized?
- **Opportunities:** Local sponsorship, charity, news, and partnership opportunities for link acquisition

This analysis feeds directly into our [link building services](/link-building-services/) strategy — providing a prioritized list of local link acquisition opportunities specific to your market.

## Geo-Grid Ranking Baseline: SoLV and WVS Scores

Standard rank tracking checks your position from a single location — usually your business address. This gives a dramatically incomplete picture of your local visibility.

Our geo-grid ranking analysis checks your position from dozens of points across your entire service area, generating a visual map of your ranking visibility:

**Share of Local Voice (SoLV):** The percentage of geo-grid points where your business appears in the top 3 (Map Pack) results for a target keyword. A SoLV of 65% means you are visible in the Map Pack from 65% of the geographic points we test.

**Weighted Visibility Score (WVS):** A composite score that weights positions by their value — position 1 is worth more than position 3, and high-population-density points are weighted more heavily than rural points. WVS provides a single number that represents your overall local visibility strength for a keyword.

### What Geo-Grid Analysis Reveals

- **Your actual ranking radius:** Most businesses are surprised to discover they rank well within 1-2 miles of their location but are invisible 3+ miles away
- **Directional strengths and weaknesses:** You might rank well to the north and east but lose visibility to the south where a strong competitor dominates
- **Competitor positioning:** Where specific competitors outrank you and why
- **Opportunity zones:** Areas with high search volume but weak competition where ranking improvement is most achievable
- **Baseline for measurement:** SoLV and WVS scores become the benchmark against which all future optimization is measured

This is the data that transforms local SEO from "we think we're doing well" to "we know exactly where we rank from every point in our service area."

## Review Profile Analysis

Beyond the GBP-specific review scoring, our local SEO audit includes a comprehensive cross-platform review analysis:

- **Review quantity by platform:** Google, Yelp, Facebook, and industry-specific platforms
- **Average rating by platform:** Discrepancies often reveal platform-specific issues
- **Review velocity trends:** Is your review generation accelerating, decelerating, or flat?
- **Sentiment analysis:** Recurring themes in positive and negative reviews — what do customers praise? What do they complain about?
- **Keyword presence in reviews:** Do customers naturally mention your services and location in their reviews?
- **Response rate and quality:** Across all platforms, not just Google
- **Competitive benchmarking:** Your review profile vs. the top 3 ranking competitors on every metric

The review analysis often reveals the fastest path to ranking improvement. A business with strong [technical SEO](/technical-seo-services/) and good GBP optimization that is still stuck behind competitors in the Map Pack almost always has a review gap — either in volume, velocity, or rating.

## Local Competitor Analysis

You do not rank in isolation — your position is relative to every other business targeting the same keywords in the same geography. Our local competitor analysis examines:

- **Who is actually in the Map Pack** for your target keywords (and why they are there)
- **Their GBP optimization level** compared to yours
- **Their review profile strength** (quantity, rating, velocity, response rate)
- **Their citation consistency** and directory presence
- **Their local link profile** (where they earn links that you do not)
- **Their on-site local signals** (NAP placement, local schema, location page quality)
- **Their content strategy** (do they have service-area pages? Blog content? FAQ sections?)

This analysis identifies the specific gaps between your local presence and the businesses outranking you — providing a clear, prioritized roadmap for closing those gaps.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How is a local SEO audit different from a regular SEO audit?

A regular SEO audit focuses primarily on your website — technical health, on-page optimization, backlinks, and content. A local SEO audit examines all of that plus the local-specific signals that determine Map Pack rankings: Google Business Profile optimization, citation consistency, geo-grid ranking patterns, review profiles, and local link equity. For local businesses, the local signals are often more important than the website signals for Map Pack visibility.

### How often should I get a local SEO audit?

We recommend a comprehensive local SEO audit annually, with quarterly check-ins on key metrics (GBP score, citation consistency, SoLV/WVS trends, review velocity). The local search landscape changes — competitors optimize their profiles, Google updates its local algorithm, and your own business evolves. Annual re-audits ensure your strategy stays aligned with current conditions.

### Can I do a local SEO audit myself?

You can check some basics — is your GBP information accurate, do your major citations match, are you responding to reviews. But a comprehensive local SEO audit requires enterprise-grade tools for geo-grid ranking analysis, citation scanning across 50+ directories, and competitive intelligence that consumer-grade tools cannot provide. More importantly, raw data without expert interpretation is just noise. Our audit contextualizes every finding within your specific market and competition.

### What happens after the local SEO audit?

You receive the full report and a strategy call to walk through every finding. From there, you can take the recommendations and implement them yourself, engage us for ongoing [local SEO services](/local-seo-services/) to execute the roadmap, or start with specific quick wins and expand as you see results. There is no obligation — the audit is a standalone deliverable that provides value regardless of whether you engage us for ongoing work.

### How long does a local SEO audit take?

Our free visibility scan is delivered within 2-3 business days. The comprehensive local SEO audit takes 5-7 business days, depending on the number of locations and the size of your competitive market. Multi-location audits (3+ locations) take 7-10 business days. The thoroughness of the analysis is what makes it valuable — we do not rush audits.
