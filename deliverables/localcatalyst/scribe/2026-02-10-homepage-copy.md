## Problem/Agitate Section

### H2
`Why Local Businesses Struggle to Get Found Online`

### Content
You've got a great business. Your customers love you. But when someone searches "plumber near me" or "best Italian restaurant in [city]," you're nowhere to be found.

You're buried on page three of Google. Your Google Business Profile hasn't been touched in months. Your competitors with worse service are getting all the calls.

**Here's the truth:** Local search isn't about having a website anymore. It's about owning your Google Business Profile, ranking in the Map Pack, and showing up exactly when customers need you.

That's where we come in.
