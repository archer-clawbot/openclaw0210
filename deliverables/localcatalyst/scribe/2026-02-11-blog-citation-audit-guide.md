A citation audit is the process of systematically reviewing every online mention of your business information to identify inconsistencies, duplicates, and errors that weaken your local SEO. Even businesses that initially built clean citations can develop problems over time as aggregators overwrite data, platforms merge or update, and business details change. Our [citation building services](/citation-building-services/) begin with a comprehensive audit because building new citations on top of a foundation of inconsistent data is counterproductive.

This guide walks you through the complete citation audit process, from preparation to prioritized corrections, using the tools and techniques that produce the most thorough results.

## Why Citation Audits Are Necessary

Citation profiles degrade over time even without any action on your part. Here is how inconsistencies creep in:

**Data aggregator overwrites.** Aggregators regularly push data to downstream directories. If an aggregator has an older version of your business information, it can overwrite corrections you made directly on individual platforms.

**Platform mergers and migrations.** When directories merge, get acquired, or undergo major platform changes, business data can be lost, duplicated, or corrupted during the transition.

**Third-party edits.** Some platforms allow public edits or suggestions. A well-meaning (or malicious) user might suggest changes to your listing that introduce inaccuracies.

**Business changes without universal updates.** Any time you change your phone number, address, business name, or operating hours, every citation source needs updating. Missing even a few sources creates inconsistencies.

**Scraper-generated listings.** Automated scrapers create business listings by pulling data from various sources. If they scrape outdated or incorrect data, they generate phantom citations with wrong information.

Without regular audits, these problems compound silently, eroding your local ranking signals while you focus on other aspects of your marketing.

## Step 1: Establish Your Canonical NAP

Before auditing anything external, define the single authoritative version of your business information that everything else must match.

**Document the following in a reference file:**

- **Business Name:** The exact name as it appears on your Google Business Profile. Include or exclude suffixes like "LLC" or "Inc." consistently.
- **Street Address:** One standardized format. Decide on "Street" vs. "St.", "Suite" vs. "Ste.", and formatting for unit/suite numbers.
- **City, State, ZIP:** Full state name or two-letter abbreviation, used consistently.
- **Primary Phone Number:** One format used everywhere. Choose (555) 555-0123 or 555-555-0123 and standardize.
- **Website URL:** Including or excluding "www." and with or without a trailing slash, used consistently.

This canonical NAP becomes the benchmark against which every citation is evaluated.

## Step 2: Audit Your Own Website

Your website is the one source you fully control. Audit it first.

**Check these locations:**
- Header (navigation bar contact info)
- Footer (contact details)
- Contact page
- About page
- Location pages (multi-location businesses)
- Schema markup (JSON-LD structured data in page source)
- Any embedded maps or widgets that display business info

Every instance of your NAP on your website must match your canonical format exactly. Pay particular attention to schema markup, which search engines process as a direct data source. A mismatch between your visible NAP and your schema NAP sends conflicting signals.

## Step 3: Audit Your Google Business Profile

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the single most important citation source and the primary reference point for Google's local algorithm.

**Verify the following in your GBP dashboard:**
- Business name matches canonical NAP
- Address matches canonical NAP (including formatting)
- Primary phone number matches canonical NAP
- Website URL is correct and uses the right format
- Business categories are accurate and complete
- Operating hours are current
- No unauthorized edits or suggestions pending

If your GBP information does not match your canonical NAP, correct it in GBP first. Then update your canonical reference to reflect whatever format GBP standardizes to (Google sometimes reformats addresses).

## Step 4: Use Automated Citation Scanning Tools

Manual discovery of every citation across the web is impractical. Use one or more of these tools to scan for existing citations and flag inconsistencies.

### Moz Local

Moz Local checks your business information against major citation sources and reports inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing listings. The free check provides a basic overview; the paid service provides detailed reporting and correction tracking.

### BrightLocal Citation Tracker

BrightLocal provides comprehensive citation auditing with detailed reports showing exact inconsistencies across each platform. It is particularly useful for tracking corrections over time and monitoring for new issues.

### Whitespark Local Citation Finder

Whitespark discovers citations you may not know about by searching for your business name, phone number, and address variations across the web. It excels at finding unstructured citations and obscure directory listings.

### Semrush Listing Management

Semrush's listing management tool scans over 70 directories and reports on accuracy, completeness, and consistency. It integrates with Semrush's broader SEO toolkit for a unified view of local performance.

### Manual Google Searches

Automated tools do not catch everything. Supplement tool-based scanning with manual Google searches:

- Search your business name in quotes: `"ABC Plumbing Services"`
- Search your phone number: `"555-555-0123"`
- Search your address: `"123 Main Street Austin TX"`
- Search common misspellings or old versions of your business name

These searches reveal citations that automated tools may miss, particularly unstructured citations in blog posts, news articles, and community pages.

## Step 5: Build Your Citation Inventory

Compile your findings into a structured spreadsheet with the following columns:

| Platform | Name Listed | Address Listed | Phone Listed | URL Listed | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----------|-------------|----------------|--------------|------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Google Business Profile | ABC Plumbing | 123 Main St, Austin TX | (555) 555-0123 | abcplumbing.com | Correct | -- | Verified |
| Yelp | ABC Plumbing Services | 123 Main Street, Austin | 555-555-0123 | www.abcplumbing.com | Inconsistent | High | Name variation, address format |
| Yellow Pages | ABC Plumbing LLC | 456 Old Address Rd | (555) 555-9999 | -- | Incorrect | Critical | Old address, old phone, no URL |

**Status categories:**
- **Correct:** Matches canonical NAP exactly
- **Inconsistent:** Minor formatting differences (abbreviations, slight name variations)
- **Incorrect:** Wrong information (old address, wrong phone number, wrong business name)
- **Duplicate:** Multiple listings for the same business on the same platform
- **Missing:** Platform where a listing should exist but does not

## Step 6: Prioritize Corrections

Not all corrections carry equal urgency. Prioritize your citation cleanup based on the impact of each source.

### Critical Priority (Fix immediately)

- Google Business Profile discrepancies
- Bing Places discrepancies
- Apple Maps discrepancies
- Data aggregator errors (these propagate to downstream directories)
- Listings with completely wrong addresses or phone numbers

### High Priority (Fix within 1-2 weeks)

- Major platform inconsistencies (Yelp, Facebook, BBB)
- Industry-specific directory errors
- Duplicate listings on any platform
- Listings with old phone numbers still routing to active lines

### Medium Priority (Fix within 1 month)

- Formatting inconsistencies on Tier 3 general directories (Street vs. St.)
- Minor name variations on lower-authority platforms
- Missing listings on relevant platforms

### Low Priority (Fix as time allows)

- Formatting issues on low-authority directories
- Unstructured citations with minor inaccuracies
- Listings on platforms you cannot claim or edit

## Step 7: Execute Corrections

Work through your prioritized list systematically.

**For claimed listings:** Log into each platform and update the business information directly. Save confirmation screenshots for your records.

**For unclaimed listings:** Most platforms allow you to claim ownership of an existing listing. Claiming typically requires verification (phone call, postcard, email, or document upload). Claim the listing first, then correct the information.

**For listings you cannot claim:** Contact the platform directly. Most directories have a "suggest an edit" or "report a problem" feature. For platforms without self-service correction, email their support team with your correct information and documentation.

**For data aggregators:** Submit your canonical NAP to all three major aggregators (Data Axle, Neustar Localeze, Foursquare). Aggregator corrections propagate to downstream directories over 8 to 12 weeks, which will automatically fix many of your lower-priority inconsistencies.

**For duplicate listings:** On each platform with duplicates, identify the primary listing (usually the one with reviews), ensure it has your canonical NAP, and request removal of the duplicate. Most platforms have a duplicate removal or merge process.

## Step 8: Verify and Monitor

After making corrections, allow 4 to 8 weeks for changes to process and propagate, then re-audit to verify:

- **Re-scan with automated tools** to confirm corrections were accepted and persisted.
- **Check aggregator downstream** to verify corrections propagated to dependent directories.
- **Monitor for regression** where platforms revert to old data from cached or aggregator sources.

Schedule quarterly citation audits going forward to catch new inconsistencies before they accumulate. Our [on-page SEO services](/on-page-seo-services/) include ongoing citation monitoring as part of a comprehensive local SEO maintenance program.

## Common Citation Audit Pitfalls

**Fixing individual directories without fixing aggregators.** If your aggregator data is wrong, your manual corrections may be overwritten by the next aggregator push. Always fix aggregators first.

**Ignoring duplicate listings.** Duplicates are not just inconsistencies; they actively confuse search engines and can cause your legitimate listing to be suppressed. Prioritize duplicate removal.

**Rushing the verification process.** Some platforms take days or weeks to process verification requests. Do not skip claiming a listing just because verification is slow. Unclaimed listings are vulnerable to future third-party edits.

**Not documenting your canonical NAP.** Without a documented reference, different team members may submit slightly different versions of your information when creating new listings or responding to correction requests.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should I do a citation audit?

Perform a comprehensive audit at least twice per year, with quarterly spot-checks on your most important platforms (Google, Bing, Apple, major directories). If your business has recently changed its name, address, phone number, or any major operating detail, perform an immediate audit following the change.

### How long does a full citation audit take?

For a business with a moderate citation profile (50 to 80 listings), a thorough audit using automated tools plus manual verification typically takes 4 to 8 hours. The correction and follow-up phase can span several weeks as you work through verification processes and wait for aggregator propagation.

### What if I find citations I did not create?

This is common. Data aggregators, scrapers, and automated directory systems create business listings without your knowledge or consent. Treat them the same as any other citation: if the information is correct, leave it. If it is wrong, claim it and correct it, or contact the platform for removal.

### Can a citation audit reveal why my local rankings dropped?

Yes. Citation inconsistencies are one of the most common and most overlooked causes of local ranking declines. If your rankings dropped following a phone number change, address update, or business rebrand, a citation audit will likely reveal dozens of listings with outdated information that are actively undermining your local signals.
