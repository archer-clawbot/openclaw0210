- Timeline and milestones
- Expected ROI and traffic projections
- Clear next steps

---

#### 3. Competitive Intelligence
We'll show you:
- Where your competitors are beating you
- What they're doing right (and wrong)
- Gaps you can exploit
- Market positioning opportunities

---

#### 4. Honest Recommendations
We'll tell you:
- Whether SEO is the right investment for your business right now
- What you can DIY vs. what needs expert help

**No BS. No pressure. Just honest guidance.**

### H2: Who Should Schedule a Call

**You're a great fit if:**
- ✅ You're a local business (service area or storefront)
- ✅ You're losing customers to competitors who rank higher
- ✅ You're ready to invest in marketing that delivers ROI
- ✅ You want transparency and data, not vague promises
- ✅ You have realistic expectations (SEO takes 8-12 weeks for full impact)

**You're NOT a great fit if:**
- ❌ You need results tomorrow (SEO is a medium-term investment)
- ❌ You're not willing to invest at least $800/month for 6 months
- ❌ You just want the cheapest option (we're good, not cheap)
- ❌ You want us to use black-hat tactics or shortcuts
- ❌ You're not open to data-driven recommendations

**We work with serious businesses who are ready to dominate their markets. If that's you, let's talk.**

#### Step 2: We Audit Your Presence
Before the call, we'll:
- Analyze your Google Business Profile

- Review your website's technical SEO

You'll get real data, not generic observations.

- Your questions

**No sales pitch. No pressure. Just honest guidance.**

After the call:
- We'll send you a detailed proposal (if you want one)
- You take time to review and decide
- We're here to answer questions, not push you to sign

**We only work with businesses who are genuinely excited to work with us. If it's not a fit, we'll tell you.**

### H2: Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What if I'm not ready to hire an agency?**  
A: That's fine. We'll still give you the audit and recommendations. You can implement them yourself or come back when you're ready.

**Q: Do you work with businesses outside the US?**  
A: Currently, we focus on US-based businesses because local SEO strategies vary significantly by region. We may expand internationally in the future.

**Q: How much do your services cost?**  
A: Our services start at $800/month for ongoing GBP management. Most clients invest $1,500-3,000/month depending on market competitiveness and scope. We'll give you exact pricing on the strategy call.

**Q: How long until I see results?**  
A: Quick wins (like GBP optimization) can show movement in 2-4 weeks. Full local SEO campaigns typically show significant results within 8-12 weeks. We'll give you a realistic timeline based on your market.

**Q: Do you guarantee #1 rankings?**  
A: No. Anyone who guarantees #1 rankings is lying. We do guarantee transparent methodology, consistent execution, and measurable progress. Rankings follow when you do SEO right.

**Q: What if I've been burned by an SEO agency before?**  
A: We hear that a lot. Most agencies overpromise and underdeliver. We do the opposite — we set realistic expectations and then exceed them. Our transparent reporting means you'll always know what we're doing and why.
