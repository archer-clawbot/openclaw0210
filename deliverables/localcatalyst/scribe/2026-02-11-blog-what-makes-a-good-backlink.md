## What Makes a Good Backlink? The Quality Factors That Matter

Not all backlinks are created equal. A single link from a trusted, relevant source can move rankings more than hundreds of links from low-quality directories. If you are evaluating [link building services](/link-building-services/) or assessing your own backlink profile, knowing how to distinguish a valuable backlink from a worthless or harmful one is essential.

This guide walks through each quality factor that determines whether a backlink helps your rankings, does nothing, or actively damages your site's standing with Google.

## Domain Authority and Trust

The authority of the linking domain is the most widely discussed quality factor, and for good reason. A link from a high-authority domain passes more ranking power than a link from a new or low-authority site.

### How Domain Authority Works

Domain Authority (DA), Domain Rating (DR), and similar metrics from tools like Moz, Ahrefs, and SEMrush are third-party approximations of how much trust and authority Google assigns to a domain. These scores consider the site's own backlink profile, age, content quality, and other factors.

**General benchmarks:**

| DA/DR Range | Typical Sites | Link Value |
|---|---|---|
| 70+ | Major news outlets, government sites, universities | Exceptional |
| 50-69 | Regional media, established industry publications | High |
| 30-49 | Quality niche blogs, local news sites, professional associations | Moderate to High |
| 10-29 | Small blogs, newer sites, local directories | Low to Moderate |
| 0-9 | Brand new sites, spam domains | Minimal or Negative |

**Important caveat:** Domain authority alone does not determine link value. A DA 35 site that is highly relevant to your industry and located in your service area may deliver more ranking impact for local SEO than a DA 65 site with no topical or geographic connection to your business.

### Trust Flow and Spam Score

Beyond raw authority, evaluate the trustworthiness of a linking domain. Majestic's Trust Flow metric measures how closely a site is connected to trusted seed sites. Moz's Spam Score estimates the likelihood that a domain has been penalized.

Red flags that indicate an untrustworthy linking domain:

- Spam Score above 30%
- Trust Flow significantly lower than Citation Flow (suggests manipulative link profile)
- Rapid, unnatural growth in referring domains
- Thin or auto-generated content across the site

## Relevance: The Most Underrated Factor

Relevance operates at three levels, and all three matter for determining backlink quality.

### Topical Relevance

A link from a site that covers topics related to your business carries more weight than a link from an unrelated site. Google understands topical relationships, so a link to a dental practice from a health and wellness blog signals relevance in a way that a link from an automotive forum does not.

Google's algorithms have grown increasingly sophisticated at evaluating topical relevance. The content surrounding your link, the overall topic of the linking page, and the broader editorial focus of the linking site all factor into relevance assessment.

### Page-Level Relevance

Even on a relevant site, the specific page matters. A link from a blog post about "How to Choose a Dentist" to a dental practice carries stronger relevance signals than a link from the same site's page about "Best Hiking Trails in Colorado."

### Geographic Relevance

For local businesses, geographic relevance is a critical and often overlooked quality factor. Links from sites associated with your service area, local newspapers, regional business directories, city government pages, and local organizations, carry a geographic relevance signal that reinforces your local search presence.

This is why effective [local link building strategies](/blog/link-building-strategies-local-seo/) prioritize geographically relevant sources alongside authoritative ones.

## Link Placement and Context

Where a link appears on a page affects how much value it passes.

### Editorial vs. Non-Editorial Placement

**Editorial links** appear within the body content of a page, placed by the author because the linked resource adds value to their content. These are the gold standard. They signal genuine endorsement.

**Non-editorial links** appear in sidebars, footers, author bios, comment sections, or dedicated "links" pages. These carry less weight because they typically do not represent a genuine editorial endorsement.

### Contextual Surrounding Text

Google evaluates the text surrounding a link to understand what the linked page is about. A link embedded in a relevant paragraph, surrounded by contextually related sentences, passes more topical value than an isolated link in a list.

**Strong contextual placement example:**
"For businesses struggling with local visibility, working with a firm that specializes in local search optimization ensures that every link built reinforces both topical authority and geographic relevance."

**Weak contextual placement example:**
"Resources: LocalCatalyst.ai, Other Site, Another Site"

### Position on the Page

Links higher in the main content area tend to carry more weight than links buried near the bottom of a page. This correlates with editorial intent. Links placed early in an article are more likely to be integral to the content, while links at the bottom are more likely to be afterthoughts.

---

## Anchor Text

The clickable text of a link, the anchor text, tells Google what the linked page is about. Anchor text optimization is a nuanced topic with real consequences for getting it right or wrong.

### Anchor Text Types

| Type | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Exact match | "link building services" | Powerful but risky if overused |
| Partial match | "professional link building" | Strong signal, more natural |
| Branded | "LocalCatalyst" | Safe and expected |
| Naked URL | "localcatalyst.ai" | Common in citations and directories |
| Generic | "click here" or "learn more" | Minimal keyword value |
| Natural/descriptive | "this guide to building local links" | Ideal balance of signal and safety |

A natural backlink profile contains a mix of all anchor text types. Over-optimization, particularly heavy use of exact-match anchors, triggers algorithmic filters that can suppress rankings. Proper [anchor text optimization](/blog/anchor-text-optimization/) balances keyword relevance with natural variation.

## Follow vs. Nofollow Attributes

Links carry a `rel` attribute that tells search engines how to treat them.

### Dofollow Links

Standard links without a `rel="nofollow"` attribute (commonly called "dofollow" links) pass full link equity. These are the primary target for link building.

### Nofollow Links

Links tagged with `rel="nofollow"` instruct search engines not to pass link equity. Since 2019, Google treats nofollow as a "hint" rather than a directive, meaning some nofollow links may still pass value at Google's discretion.

### Sponsored and UGC Attributes

Google introduced `rel="sponsored"` for paid links and `rel="ugc"` for user-generated content links. These provide more granular signals to search engines about the nature of a link.

### The Practical Takeaway

Dofollow links should be the priority for link building. However, a natural backlink profile includes nofollow links too. If your profile is 100% dofollow, it may appear manipulated. Nofollow links from high-authority sources (major media, Wikipedia, social platforms) still provide referral traffic and brand visibility even without direct link equity.

## Link Freshness and Velocity

When a link was acquired and how quickly your site gains links both affect backlink quality assessment.

### Freshness

Newly acquired links from active, regularly updated pages carry more weight than old links from stagnant pages. A link embedded in a blog post published last month signals current relevance more strongly than a link on a page that has not been updated in five years.

### Link Velocity

The rate at which your site gains new backlinks should appear natural. A steady, gradual increase in referring domains looks organic. A sudden spike of 500 new links in a week followed by months of inactivity looks artificial and may trigger manual review.

Healthy link velocity depends on your industry and site size, but for most local businesses, acquiring 5-20 new referring domains per month represents sustainable growth.

## How to Evaluate Your Existing Backlinks

Audit your current backlink profile using these steps:

1. **Export your backlink data** from Ahrefs, Moz, or Google Search Console.
2. **Score each link** against the quality factors above.
3. **Flag toxic links** that come from spammy, irrelevant, or penalized domains.
4. **Identify gaps** where competitors have quality links that you lack.
5. **Disavow toxic links** through Google's Disavow Tool if they pose a real penalty risk.

A thorough [SEO audit](/seo-audit-services/) includes backlink profile analysis as a core component, revealing both the strengths you can build on and the weaknesses that may be holding your rankings back.

## The Good Backlink Checklist

Use this checklist when evaluating any potential or existing backlink:

- [ ] Linking domain has DA/DR of 25 or higher
- [ ] Linking site is topically relevant to your business
- [ ] Linking page discusses topics related to your services
- [ ] For local SEO: linking site has geographic relevance to your service area
- [ ] Link is placed within editorial body content
- [ ] Surrounding text is contextually relevant
- [ ] Anchor text is natural and descriptive
- [ ] Link is dofollow (preferred but not required)
- [ ] Linking page is indexed and regularly crawled
- [ ] Linking domain has a clean spam profile

No single backlink will check every box. The goal is to build a portfolio of links where the majority score well across these factors, with a natural mix of link types, placements, and authority levels.

## FAQ

### How many good backlinks do I need to rank?

There is no universal answer. The number depends entirely on your competition. Analyze the backlink profiles of sites currently ranking for your target keywords and use their referring domain counts and quality distribution as your benchmark. For local SEO, 30-50 high-quality, geographically relevant referring domains often provide a competitive foundation in moderate markets.

### Are backlinks from social media considered good?

Social media links are almost universally nofollow, so they do not pass direct link equity. However, they drive referral traffic, increase content visibility, and can lead to natural editorial links when journalists or bloggers discover your content through social channels. They are valuable for indirect link building but should not be counted as part of your core backlink strategy.

### Can a good backlink become a bad one over time?

Yes. If the linking domain is sold and repurposed as a spam site, or if the linking page is modified to include spammy content, a previously valuable link can become toxic. This is why quarterly backlink audits are important. Monitor your backlink profile for changes in linking domain quality.

### Should I remove links from low-authority sites?

Not necessarily. Low-authority links are not the same as toxic links. A DA 15 local blog linking to your business is natural and expected. Only take action against links that are genuinely spammy, manipulative, or from penalized domains. A natural backlink profile includes links from sites across the authority spectrum.
