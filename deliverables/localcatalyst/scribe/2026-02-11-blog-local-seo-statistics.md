## Local Search Behavior Statistics

These numbers reveal how consumers interact with local search and what their search behavior means for your business.

1. **46% of all Google searches have local intent.** Nearly half of everything searched on Google is someone looking for a local business, service, or product. (Source: GoGulf / Google)

8. **29% of consumers search for local businesses at least once a week.** Beyond daily searches, a significant portion of the population makes local business searches a regular weekly activity. (Source: BrightLocal)

## Google Business Profile Statistics

Your Google Business Profile is the hub of your local SEO presence. These numbers demonstrate why.

9. **A complete Google Business Profile is 70% more likely to attract location visits.** Completeness is not just about checking boxes — it directly influences customer behavior. (Source: Google)

10. **Businesses with complete GBP listings are 50% more likely to lead to a purchase.** The information customers find on your profile — hours, photos, reviews, services — determines whether they convert. (Source: Google)

11. **Businesses receive an average of 1,260 views on their GBP per month.** For many local businesses, their GBP generates more impressions than their website. (Source: BrightLocal)

12. **56% of actions on Google Business Profile listings are website visits.** Your GBP drives meaningful website traffic in addition to calls and direction requests. (Source: BrightLocal)

13. **Businesses with more than 100 photos on their GBP receive 520% more calls and 2,717% more direction requests than average.** Photo quantity has a dramatic correlation with engagement. (Source: BrightLocal)

14. **Google Business Profile listings with photos receive 42% more direction requests and 35% more website clicks than those without.** Even a modest photo set outperforms no photos at all. (Source: Google)

16. **GBP posts with photos get 10x more engagement than text-only posts.** If you are publishing GBP posts without images, you are leaving engagement on the table. (Source: Search Engine Journal)

## The Local Pack and SERP Statistics

Understanding how users interact with local search results helps you focus on the right positions.

17. **The local pack appears in approximately 93% of searches with local intent.** If your business is not in the local pack, you are missing the most prominent local search feature. (Source: Moz)

20. **The top 3 local pack positions receive 75% of all local pack clicks.** Position 1 dominates, and positions 2 and 3 collectively capture most of the remainder. Being ranked fourth or beyond means very few clicks. (Source: Backlinko)

21. **Zero-click searches account for approximately 65% of Google searches.** Many local searches are resolved directly on the SERP (users find the phone number, address, or hours without clicking through). This makes GBP optimization even more critical. (Source: SparkToro / Jumpshot)

## Review Statistics

Reviews influence rankings, click-through rates, and purchasing decisions. The data is unambiguous.

22. **87% of consumers read online reviews for local businesses.** Review reading is not a niche behavior — it is the norm. (Source: BrightLocal)

25. **Businesses with an average rating of 4.0-4.5 stars earn the most revenue from local search.** Counterintuitively, a perfect 5.0 rating can appear less trustworthy than a high-but-imperfect rating. (Source: Womply)

26. **Responding to reviews improves your local search ranking.** Google has explicitly confirmed that review responses are a factor. (Source: Google Support Documentation)

27. **53% of consumers expect a business to respond to negative reviews within a week.** Delayed responses to negative feedback erode trust. (Source: ReviewTrackers)

28. **Businesses that respond to at least 25% of their reviews earn 35% more revenue than those that do not respond.** Review engagement has a direct financial impact. (Source: Womply)

## Citation and NAP Statistics

Citations are the verification network that confirms your business's information to search engines.

40. **68% of consumers would stop using a local business if they found incorrect information in online directories.** Inaccurate citations actively drive customers away. (Source: BrightLocal)

41. **The average local business has 70+ citations across the web.** Managing citation accuracy at this scale requires systematic auditing, which is a core part of [citation building services](/citation-building-services/). (Source: Moz)

## Link Building and Authority Statistics

Backlinks remain a foundational factor in both local and organic rankings.
