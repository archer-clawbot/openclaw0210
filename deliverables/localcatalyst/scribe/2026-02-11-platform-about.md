# We Built an AI System. Then We Let You Use It.

LocalCatalyst did not start as a platform. It started as a local SEO agency with a scaling problem.

---

## The Agency That Couldn't Scale

In 2024, we were managing over 20 local SEO clients. Dentists, HVAC companies, law firms, plumbers, restaurants -- the kind of businesses that live and die by local search visibility. We were doing good work. Rankings were climbing. Clients were happy.

But the work was crushing us.

Every client needed an audit. Every audit generated 50-100 action items. Every action item required research, writing, implementation, and QA. Multiply that by 20 clients and you have a team that is perpetually behind, perpetually hiring, and perpetually training new people who take months to get up to speed.

We tried the usual solutions. Hired more people. Built SOPs. Created templates. It helped -- for about three weeks. Then we were behind again. The bottleneck was never strategy. It was execution capacity.

So we built something different.

---

## 18 AI Agents. One System.

Instead of hiring another ten people, we started building AI agents. Not chatbots. Not prompt templates. Specialized agents, each trained on a specific discipline of local SEO.

**Scout** crawls websites, collects data, and maps competitive landscapes. **Silas** runs full SEO audits against 200+ ranking factors and produces scored, prioritized reports. **Scribe** writes SEO content -- blog posts, service pages, location pages -- with proper keyword targeting, header structure, and internal linking. **Wrench** generates schema markup and handles technical implementations. **Herald** manages Google Business Profile optimization. **Razor** does citation audits and builds citation profiles across 50+ directories.

There are 18 agents in total. Each one handles a specific piece of the SEO execution pipeline. They communicate through a central dispatch system. They follow the same methodology. They produce the same quality of work whether it is 2 AM on a Tuesday or noon on a Friday.

We call the system **CATALYST** -- and it is the methodology and engine behind everything we deliver.

---

## From Internal Tool to Open Platform

For the first year, this system only served our managed clients. We used it to scale from 20 clients to over 30 without adding headcount. Turnaround times dropped from weeks to hours. Deliverable quality became consistent -- every audit, every content piece, every schema package followed the same framework.

Then we realized something. The individual deliverables this system produces -- audits, topical maps, content pages, schema markup, GBP optimization packages -- are exactly what thousands of businesses and agencies need but cannot get without a retainer, a contract, or a freelancer who may or may not show up.

So we opened it up.

Now, anyone can order the same deliverables our managed clients receive. A la carte. No retainer. No minimum commitment. You pick the product, enter your business details, and the system goes to work. A [topical map](/services/topical-map/) for $397. An [SEO audit](/services/seo-audit/) for $297. [Content pages](/services/content-pages/) for $69-97 each. [Schema markup](/services/schema-markup/) for $197. The same outputs that power our managed campaigns, available on demand.

## What We Have Built So Far

This is not a concept. The system is running production workloads every day.

- **Actively managing 20+ clients** on the CATALYST system
- **Hundreds of SEO audits completed** -- scored, prioritized, delivered as branded PDF reports
- **Thousands of content pages written** -- blog posts, service pages, location pages, landing pages
- **Thousands of citations built and verified** across 50+ directory networks
- **Schema packages deployed** across WordPress, Shopify, and custom-built sites

The numbers grow every week because the system does not sleep, does not call in sick, and does not need to be managed. It needs to be directed -- and that is where we come in.

## The Team

### Cody -- Founder and Operator

Cody built LocalCatalyst out of the realization that local SEO execution is a solved problem. The strategy matters. The quality standards matter. The methodology matters. But the execution itself -- the writing, the auditing, the schema generation, the citation building -- is systematic enough that AI agents can do it at scale, at speed, and at a fraction of the cost.

Cody oversees the system, sets quality standards, manages client strategy for managed accounts, and is the person you talk to if you call. He is not a figurehead. He is the operator who built the agents and runs the platform.

### The AI Fleet

Eighteen specialized agents, each handling a defined scope within the CATALYST methodology. They are not general-purpose AI tools. They are purpose-built systems trained on local SEO data, running structured workflows, and producing deliverables that follow strict quality frameworks.

Think of it like this: Cody is the general contractor. The agents are the specialists -- the electrician, the plumber, the framer, the roofer. Each one does their job within the system. The system is what delivers results.

## The CATALYST Methodology

Everything we do -- every agent, every deliverable, every managed engagement -- follows the CATALYST framework:

1. **Crawl and Collect** -- Agents gather data on your site, your competitors, your market, and your current visibility
2. **Audit and Analyze** -- Data is processed into scored findings with clear priority rankings
3. **Target and Map** -- Keywords, topics, and content gaps are mapped into a strategic architecture
4. **Author and Build** -- Content is written, schema is generated, citations are submitted, GBP is optimized
5. **Launch and Deploy** -- Deliverables are packaged, quality-checked, and delivered or deployed
6. **Yield and Measure** -- Results are tracked, reported, and fed back into the system for continuous improvement
7. **Scale and Expand** -- Winning strategies are amplified, new opportunities are pursued, authority compounds

This is not a marketing acronym bolted onto generic services. It is the actual operating logic of the system. Every agent knows where it sits in the CATALYST pipeline, what inputs it receives, and what outputs it must produce.
