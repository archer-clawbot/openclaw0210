Keyword research for [medical practices](/industries/medical-practices/) is fundamentally different from keyword research for other local businesses. Patients don't search the way consumers shop. They search with urgency, with specific symptoms, with insurance questions, and with geographic constraints that shift depending on whether they need routine care or an urgent specialist. If your keyword strategy doesn't reflect these search behaviors, you're optimizing for the wrong terms.

This guide breaks down the keyword categories that matter for medical practice SEO, shows you how to build a prioritized target list, and explains how to map keywords to pages so every piece of content on your site earns traffic. For a deeper dive into the methodology, see our [local keyword research](/local-seo-services/local-keyword-research/) service page.

## The Five Keyword Categories for Medical Practices

Medical practice keywords fall into five distinct categories, each representing a different stage of the patient journey and a different page type on your website.

### 1. Specialty + Location Keywords (Highest Intent)

These are your bread-and-butter terms. A patient searching "cardiologist in Austin" or "pediatrician near downtown Denver" has already decided they need a specific type of doctor and is actively choosing one.

**Examples:**
- "family doctor in [city]"
- "orthopedic surgeon [neighborhood]"
- "OB/GYN near me"
- "dermatologist [zip code]"
- "internal medicine physician [city]"

**Target pages:** Location pages, homepage, Google Business Profile

**Why they matter:** These terms drive the local pack results. They have moderate-to-high search volume (50-500 monthly searches per term in most metros) and extremely high conversion intent. A patient searching these terms is typically booking an appointment within 24-48 hours.

### 2. Condition and Symptom Keywords (Mid-Funnel)

Patients frequently search for their symptoms or diagnosed conditions before searching for a doctor. These searches represent an earlier stage — the patient is researching, not yet choosing a provider.

**Examples:**
- "treatment for lower back pain [city]"
- "what causes recurring headaches"
- "high blood pressure management near me"
- "eczema treatment options"
- "when to see a doctor for chest pain"

**Target pages:** Condition pages, service pages, blog posts

**Volume and intent vary widely.** National symptom queries ("what causes recurring headaches") have high volume but diffuse intent. Localized condition queries ("eczema treatment in Portland") have lower volume but much higher conversion potential. Prioritize the localized variants for your condition and service pages. Use the national variants for blog content that builds topical authority and captures top-of-funnel traffic.

### 3. Insurance and Access Keywords (Decision Stage)

These keywords reveal a patient who has chosen to seek care but is navigating the logistics of access. They're high-intent and wildly underserved by most medical practice websites.

**Examples:**
- "doctors that accept Blue Cross Blue Shield in [city]"
- "Medicaid pediatrician near me"
- "walk-in clinic that accepts Aetna"
- "same-day doctor appointment [city]"
- "Saturday doctor's office [city]"
- "no insurance doctor visit cost [city]"

**Target pages:** Insurance/billing page, dedicated insurance-specific landing pages, FAQ pages

**Why they're undervalued:** Most practices never create content targeting these terms. Yet patients searching "doctors that accept [insurance plan] in [city]" are ready to book immediately — they just need to verify coverage. A single page listing the insurance plans you accept, optimized for each plan name + your city, can capture dozens of these long-tail queries.

### 4. Provider-Name Keywords (Referral Capture)

When patients receive a referral or recommendation, they search for the doctor by name.

**Examples:**
- "Dr. Sarah Chen reviews"
- "Dr. Michael Torres Austin TX"
- "Dr. [Name] [Practice Name]"

**Target pages:** Individual provider profile pages

If you don't have optimized provider pages, these searches land on Healthgrades, Zocdoc, WebMD, or Vitals — platforms where you don't control the narrative and where competitors often advertise alongside your profile. Building individual provider pages on your own site (with schema markup, credentials, and patient reviews) lets you own this real estate.

### 5. Service-Specific Keywords (Procedure/Treatment)

Patients searching for specific procedures or treatments represent both new patient acquisition and existing patient retention opportunities.

**Examples:**
- "sports physical near me"
- "annual wellness exam [city]"
- "allergy testing doctor [city]"
- "cortisone injection for knee pain [city]"
- "telehealth doctor visit [state]"
- "DOT physical [city]"

**Target pages:** Individual service pages

**The long-tail opportunity is enormous.** Each service your practice offers generates 5-20 keyword variations when you factor in location modifiers, insurance modifiers, and "near me" variants. A practice offering 15 services has a potential keyword universe of 100-300 terms — each one deserving a page or section of content.

## Building Your Keyword Priority List

Not all keywords deserve equal investment. Prioritize using these three factors:

**Search volume:** How many people search this term monthly in your market? Use tools like Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or Semrush to pull local volume estimates. Don't rely on national numbers — a term with 10,000 national searches might have 50 local searches in your metro.

**Competition:** Check who currently ranks for each term. If the top 10 results are all major health systems with domain authorities above 70, a single-location practice will struggle to compete on that term alone. Look for terms where independent practices, directories, or low-authority sites appear in the results — these represent realistic opportunities.

**Conversion potential:** A patient searching "pediatrician near me" is almost certainly booking an appointment. A patient searching "when should I take my child to the doctor for a fever" might be, or might resolve the question from the content alone. Weight keywords that signal immediate appointment intent higher than informational queries.

**Practical prioritization framework:**

| Priority | Keyword Type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | Specialty + Location | Optimize location pages and GBP immediately |
| Tier 1 | Provider names | Build/optimize individual provider pages |
| Tier 2 | Insurance + Access | Create insurance page, FAQ content |
| Tier 2 | Top 5 services + Location | Build dedicated service pages |
| Tier 3 | Condition + Location | Create condition-specific pages |
| Tier 3 | Remaining services | Build out remaining service pages |
| Tier 4 | Symptom/informational | Blog content strategy, ongoing |

## Mapping Keywords to Pages

Every target keyword needs a designated page. Without explicit mapping, you end up with keyword cannibalization — multiple pages competing for the same term, diluting the authority of each.

**Rules for keyword-page mapping:**

1. **One primary keyword per page.** Your location page targets "family doctor in [city]." Your diabetes service page targets "diabetes management doctor [city]." These don't compete because the intent is distinct.

2. **Secondary keywords cluster naturally.** Your "pediatrician in Austin" page will also rank for "kids doctor Austin," "children's doctor near me," and "pediatric care Austin" without separate pages for each. Group semantic variants together.

3. **Blog posts target informational intent.** Pages target transactional intent ("hire/book/visit"), blog posts target informational intent ("how/what/why/when"). Don't write a blog post targeting "pediatrician in Austin" — that's what your service page is for.

4. **Create a keyword map spreadsheet.** Columns: keyword, monthly volume, current ranking, target page URL, priority tier. Review quarterly and update as rankings change and new opportunities emerge.

## Local Modifiers That Multiply Your Keyword Universe

Medical practices serve specific geographies. Every core keyword expands when you apply local modifiers:

- **City name:** "dermatologist in Phoenix"
- **Neighborhood/district:** "dermatologist in Scottsdale"
- **Zip code:** "dermatologist 85251"
- **"Near me":** "dermatologist near me" (optimized through GBP and location signals, not by literally putting "near me" on your page)
- **County:** "dermatologist Maricopa County"
- **Landmark/area:** "dermatologist near ASU" or "doctor near [hospital name]"

For multi-location practices, each location page should target its own set of geographic modifiers. A practice with offices in three neighborhoods has three distinct sets of location-modified keywords to target.

LocalCatalyst maps these geographic keywords using geo-grid analysis, which shows your visibility at specific lat/long points across your service area. This reveals not just which keywords you rank for, but where geographically within your market you're strong or weak — data that standard keyword tools can't provide.

## FAQ

### How often should I update my keyword research?
Review your keyword map quarterly. Search behavior shifts with seasons (flu-related searches spike October through February), new competitors enter your market, and Google's algorithm changes can reshuffle rankings. A quarterly review catches these shifts before they erode your traffic. Annual keyword research is too infrequent for a competitive medical market.

### Should I target competitor doctor names as keywords?
You can create content that ranks for competitor-adjacent searches (like "best alternative to [Competitor Practice]" or comparison content), but bidding on or deliberately targeting a competitor doctor's name is ethically questionable and can trigger legal issues around trademark and right-of-publicity claims. Focus on owning your own provider name searches and competing on service and condition terms where the patient hasn't yet chosen a provider.

### How do I find what keywords my competitors rank for?
Use Ahrefs, Semrush, or Moz to pull the organic keyword profile of competing practices in your area. Enter their domain and export the full keyword list. Filter for keywords with local intent and volume above 10. This gives you a ready-made list of terms to evaluate for your own strategy — especially terms where competitors rank on page 1 but you don't appear at all. These gaps represent the fastest path to new patient traffic.
