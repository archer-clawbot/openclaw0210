## What a Real SEO Audit Looks Like

Most "SEO audits" are automated reports from tools like SEMrush or Screaming Frog. You get a 40-page PDF full of colored bars and jargon, and you have no idea what to do with it.

A LocalCatalyst audit is different. You get a scored analysis of every factor affecting your rankings -- technical, on-page, GBP, and competitive -- with a prioritized action plan that tells you exactly what to fix, in what order, and why it matters.

Here's what a sample audit covers:

- **CATALYST Score: 4.2 / 10** -- Your overall SEO health
- **Technical SEO: 5.1 / 10** -- Site speed, crawlability, indexation, Core Web Vitals, mobile usability, HTTPS status, sitemap health
- **On-Page SEO: 3.8 / 10** -- Title tags, meta descriptions, header structure, keyword usage, content depth, internal linking
- **Google Business Profile: 6.2 / 10** -- Completeness, categories, description optimization, photos, reviews, Q&As, posting activity
- **Competitive Position: 3.1 / 10** -- Where you rank vs. the top 3 competitors for your primary keywords, content gaps, backlink gaps

Each section includes specific findings, the impact level (high / medium / low), and the recommended fix. No vague advice. No "consider improving your content." Concrete actions you can take or hand off.

## The CATALYST Scoring System

Your audit includes a CATALYST score from 1 to 10 that represents your overall local SEO health. Here's how to read it:

| Score | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 1-3 | Critical issues. Major technical problems or missing fundamentals. |
| 4-5 | Below average. Foundations exist but significant gaps remain. |
| 6-7 | Competitive. Solid base with room for targeted improvements. |
| 8-9 | Strong. Fine-tuning and expansion opportunities. |
| 10 | Dominant. Maintaining position and expanding reach. |

Most businesses we audit score between 3.5 and 5.5. That's normal. The score isn't meant to make you feel bad -- it's meant to show you where the biggest gains are waiting.

---

## What You Provide

- Your website URL
- Google Business Profile link (if you have one)
- Target keywords (optional -- we'll identify them if you're unsure)
- Primary service area (city/region)

Takes about 3 minutes to fill out the order form.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is this just a Screaming Frog report?**
No. Screaming Frog is one of many data sources our system uses. The audit is generated by multiple specialized AI agents that crawl your site, analyze your competitors, evaluate your GBP, and compile findings into a scored, prioritized report. The output is an analysis, not a data dump.

**Will you fix the issues you find?**
The audit identifies the issues and tells you what to do about them. You can hand the action plan to your developer, your marketing team, or use our other products to address specific areas. Need content? Order [content pages](/services/content-pages/). Need schema? Order [schema markup](/services/schema-markup/). Need GBP help? Order [GBP optimization](/services/gbp-optimization/).

**How is this different from the free audit tools online?**
Free audit tools check basic technical factors -- broken links, page speed, missing meta tags. They don't analyze your competitive landscape, score your GBP, identify content gaps, or create a prioritized action plan. The LocalCatalyst audit evaluates your site the way a senior SEO strategist would, across every factor that affects local rankings.

**Can I use this to pitch a client?**
Absolutely. The Comprehensive tier is designed for this. Agencies and freelancers use our audits as the foundation for proposals. The PDF is professionally formatted and white-label ready.

**What if my site is brand new?**
New sites get audited too. The report will focus more on what needs to be built rather than what needs to be fixed, and the competitive analysis will show you exactly what it takes to enter your market.
