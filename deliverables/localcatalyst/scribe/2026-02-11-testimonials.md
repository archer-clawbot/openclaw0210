## Client Testimonials

### "Went from page 3 to Map Pack #1 for 14 keywords in 8 weeks."

> "We had been stuck on page 2 and 3 for our most important service keywords for over a year. Our previous agency kept saying 'give it more time,' but nothing was changing. LocalCatalyst came in, did a thorough audit, and found a list of technical issues nobody had caught. Within eight weeks, we were in the Map Pack for 14 of our target keywords. The phone started ringing so much we had to hire another technician."

**Rating:** 5.0/5
**--- Kevin Morales, Owner**
*Catalyst Comfort HVAC | Fort Worth, TX*

### "New patient bookings up 185% in 90 days."

> "As a dental practice, we were competing against large DSO groups with massive marketing budgets. We didn't think we could compete in local search, but LocalCatalyst showed us that local SEO is a different game --- and one we could win. They optimized our GBP, built out location-specific content, and helped us generate over 60 new reviews in three months. New patient bookings went up 185%, and our cost per acquisition dropped by more than half."

**Rating:** 5.0/5
**--- Dr. Priya Nair, DDS**
*Bright Smile Family Dentistry | Scottsdale, AZ*

### "#1 for 'italian restaurant [neighborhood]' in 60 days."

> "Restaurant SEO is brutal. Everyone's fighting for the same three Map Pack spots, and the competition changes weekly. LocalCatalyst understood the restaurant vertical from day one --- they knew exactly which categories to add to our GBP, how to structure our menu pages for search, and how to build local links that actually moved the needle. We hit #1 for our primary keyword in under two months. Reservations from Google are up 40%."

**Rating:** 4.9/5
**--- Antonio Ferrara, Owner**
*Ferrara's Trattoria | Denver, CO*

### "Organic leads now outperform our $8K/month PPC spend."

> "We were spending $8,000 a month on Google Ads and getting decent results, but the cost per lead kept climbing. LocalCatalyst built out our organic presence so effectively that within six months, our organic leads surpassed our paid leads --- at a fraction of the cost. We've cut our PPC budget by 60% and we're getting more total leads than before. The ROI on their service is honestly hard to believe until you see the numbers."

**Rating:** 5.0/5
**--- Rachel Whitfield, Managing Partner**
*Whitfield & Associates Law Firm | Austin, TX*

### "GBP leads went from 3 to 23 per month."

> "I'm a plumber, not a marketing guy. I didn't even know what a GBP was before LocalCatalyst explained it to me. They optimized my profile, helped me get my reviews up from 12 to 78, fixed a bunch of wrong listings across the internet, and now I'm getting 23 leads a month just from my Google profile. Before working with them, I was lucky to get 3. Best money I spend every month, hands down."

**Rating:** 5.0/5
**--- Derek Simmons, Owner**
*Simmons Plumbing Services | San Antonio, TX*

### "Best marketing investment we've ever made."

> "We've tried everything --- mailers, radio, Yelp ads, Angi leads, two different SEO agencies. Nothing stuck. LocalCatalyst was different from the first call. They showed us exactly where we were losing visibility and laid out a clear plan to fix it. Four months in, we're ranking in the Map Pack for all of our core services, and the quality of leads coming through Google is way higher than what we were getting from lead gen platforms. This is the best marketing investment we've ever made."

**Rating:** 4.9/5
**--- Troy and Linda Pearson, Owners**
*Pearson's Auto Repair | Oklahoma City, OK*

### "Finally, an SEO agency that explains what they're doing."

> "I've worked with three SEO agencies in the past five years. Two of them sent monthly reports I couldn't understand and couldn't explain their strategy when I asked. The third one was clearly doing nothing. LocalCatalyst is the first agency that has ever walked me through their work in plain language. I understand exactly what they're doing, why they're doing it, and how it connects to patient bookings. That transparency alone is worth the investment."

**Rating:** 5.0/5
**--- Dr. James Okafor, Medical Director**
*Pinnacle Family Medicine | Charlotte, NC*

### "Appointments from Google tripled in the first quarter."

> "We're a high-end salon in a competitive market with a lot of established competitors. LocalCatalyst helped us carve out our niche by building out service-specific pages, optimizing our GBP with professional photos and targeted posts, and implementing a review generation system that took us from 24 to 91 reviews in four months. Google-sourced appointments tripled in Q1, and we've had to extend our weekend hours to keep up with demand."

**Rating:** 4.8/5
**--- Maria Santos, Owner**
*Luxe Hair Studio | Miami, FL*
