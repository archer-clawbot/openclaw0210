## Results That Speak

We track the metrics that matter to local businesses: Map Pack rankings across your entire service area, phone calls from search, direction requests, website visits from organic traffic, and revenue attributed to search visibility.

**Our Approach:**

- **Geo-Grid Rankings** — We track your visibility across a grid of GPS coordinates covering your service area, not just a single zip code. This shows exactly where you rank in every neighborhood you serve.
- **Share of Local Voice (SoLV)** — Your percentage of total local search visibility compared to every competitor in your market. This single metric tells you whether you are gaining or losing ground.
- **Weighted Visibility Score (WVS)** — A composite score that weights rankings by search volume and commercial intent. Not all keywords are equal — we focus on the ones that generate revenue.
