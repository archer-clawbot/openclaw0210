## About the Platform

### How does LocalCatalyst work?

LocalCatalyst is an AI-powered SEO deliverables platform. We built a system of 18 specialized AI agents that handle distinct pieces of the local SEO workflow -- research, auditing, content writing, schema generation, citation building, and GBP optimization. You order a product, enter your business details, and the relevant agents execute the work. Deliverables are quality-checked and delivered to you, usually within hours. You can buy individual products [a la carte](/services/) or opt for [fully managed SEO](/managed/) where we handle everything.

### How is this different from hiring an SEO agency?

A traditional agency charges a monthly retainer and you get whatever is in that package. With LocalCatalyst, you buy exactly what you need, when you need it. No retainer. No contract (unless you choose managed SEO). No paying for services you do not use. If you need an audit today and content pages next month, you order them separately. If you want the full-service agency experience, our [managed SEO](/managed/) covers that -- but you are still powered by the same AI system that delivers faster and more consistently than a team of generalist freelancers.

### How is this different from using an SEO tool like SurferSEO or Semrush?

Tools give you data and recommendations. You still have to do the work. LocalCatalyst gives you finished deliverables. When you order an [SEO audit](/services/seo-audit/), you do not get a dashboard full of metrics you need to interpret -- you get a scored, prioritized report with specific action items. When you order [content pages](/services/content-pages/), you do not get an optimization score on something you wrote -- you get the finished, ready-to-publish page. We are not a tool. We are the execution layer.

### What is the CATALYST methodology?

CATALYST is our proprietary framework for local SEO execution. It covers the full lifecycle: Crawl and Collect data, Audit and Analyze findings, Target and Map keywords, Author and Build content, Launch and Deploy deliverables, Yield and Measure results, Scale and Expand wins. Every agent in our system operates within this framework. Every deliverable follows it. [Read the full methodology breakdown](/about/our-process/).

## About Products

### Can I start with one product and add more later?

Yes. There is no minimum order and no commitment beyond what you purchase. Most customers start with a [topical map](/services/topical-map/) or [SEO audit](/services/seo-audit/) to understand their current position, then order content, schema, or GBP optimization based on what the audit reveals. You build your own stack at your own pace.

### What format do deliverables come in?

It depends on the product. Audits are delivered as branded PDF reports. Content pages come in markdown and HTML with full metadata (title tags, meta descriptions, target keywords, internal link suggestions). Schema markup is delivered as JSON-LD ready for deployment. Topical maps are delivered as structured spreadsheets with keyword data. Every product page specifies its delivery format.

### Can I see a sample before I order?

Yes. [Contact us](/services/contact/) and tell us which product you are considering. We will send you a sample deliverable so you can evaluate the quality before you spend anything.

### Do you offer white label deliverables?

Yes. All branding can be removed from any deliverable. Agencies and freelancers regularly order audits, content, and topical maps under white label to deliver to their own clients. Our [Authority content plan](/services/monthly-content/) and bulk content orders are particularly popular with resellers. No mention of LocalCatalyst appears on white-label deliverables.

## Quality and Speed

### How is this so fast?

Because the work is executed by AI agents, not a queue of human freelancers. When you place an order, the system dispatches the relevant agents immediately. An audit that would take a human team two weeks is completed in 12-24 hours. A content page that would take a freelancer three days is delivered in 2-4 hours. There is no backlog, no scheduling, and no waiting for someone to start your project.

### Is AI-generated content as good as human-written?

For SEO content, our system consistently produces work that matches or exceeds what most agencies deliver. Here is why: our agents are not writing from scratch with a blank prompt. They are executing structured workflows built on keyword research, competitive analysis, and the CATALYST content framework. Every page has proper header structure, keyword placement, internal linking, FAQ sections, and E-E-A-T signals. The output is purpose-built for search performance. That said, if you have very specific brand voice requirements or need thought leadership content, [let us know](/services/contact/) -- we can discuss a hybrid approach.

### What if I am not happy with the deliverable?

Every product includes one round of revisions. If the deliverable does not meet the stated specifications, we fix it. If it fundamentally misses the mark -- wrong direction, wrong audience, wrong scope -- we will work with you to make it right. We do not do refunds for subjective preference (you do not like the tone), but we do stand behind the quality and accuracy of every deliverable.

### Do you offer revisions?

One revision round is included with every product. Additional revisions can be arranged at a flat rate. Revisions apply to the deliverable as scoped -- if you change the target keywords or business direction after delivery, that constitutes a new order.

## Pricing and Payment

### Are there any hidden fees or contracts?

No. The price listed on each [product page](/services/) is the price you pay. There are no setup fees, onboarding charges, or hidden costs. A la carte orders are one-time purchases. [Monthly content subscriptions](/services/monthly-content/) are month-to-month with no cancellation penalty. [Managed SEO](/managed/) has a 90-day initial commitment, then goes month-to-month.

### Do you offer bulk discounts?

Yes. Content pages drop to $69/page at volume (10+ pages per order). Other products have volume pricing available -- [contact us](/services/contact/) with your scope and we will quote it. Agencies placing regular orders can set up an account with preferred pricing.

### How does managed SEO pricing work?

Managed SEO is custom-scoped based on your competitive landscape, number of locations, current SEO health, and goals. There is no public price list because the scope varies significantly between a single-location business in a small market and a 10-location franchise in a competitive metro. [Schedule a free strategy call](/free-audit/) to get a quote tailored to your situation.

### Can agencies resell these deliverables?

Yes. Many agencies use LocalCatalyst as their execution layer -- ordering audits, content, topical maps, and schema under white label and delivering them to their own clients. We offer agency pricing for volume orders and can discuss partnership arrangements for ongoing work. [Contact us](/services/contact/) to set up an agency account.
