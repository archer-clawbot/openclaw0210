# SEO Deliverables. On Demand. Powered by AI.

**Order what you need. Get it in hours. No retainers, no contracts, no waiting.**

You know what your business needs. Maybe it's a full site audit. Maybe it's 30 pages of optimized content. Maybe it's someone to finally fix your Google Business Profile.

You don't need a 12-month agency contract for that. You need the deliverable.

## The Problem With Traditional SEO

You've heard the pitch before.

An agency promises rankings, charges $2,000/month, and sends you a report you don't understand. Three months in, you're not sure what they've actually done. Six months in, you start wondering if you could have done it yourself.

Or you hire a freelancer. They're great for two weeks, then they disappear. The work is inconsistent. The deliverables are late. You're chasing someone down just to get what you paid for.

Or you try to do it yourself. You watch 47 YouTube videos, read 12 blog posts, and spend an entire weekend staring at Google Search Console. You make some changes. Nothing happens. You give up.

Here's the real problem: SEO isn't complicated. The execution is.

What if you could order exactly what you need and have it delivered by an AI system trained on thousands of local SEO campaigns? No agency overhead. No freelancer inconsistency. No guesswork.

That's what LocalCatalyst does.

## The System Behind the Deliverables

LocalCatalyst isn't a chatbot writing your content. It's a purpose-built system of 18 specialized AI agents, each trained on a different aspect of local SEO.

One agent handles technical crawls. Another analyzes competitor positioning. Another generates topical maps. Another writes content. Another builds schema markup. They work in sequence using the CATALYST methodology:

- **C**rawl and collect data
- **A**udit what you find
- **T**arget the highest-impact opportunities
- **A**rchitect a content plan
- **L**aunch optimized pages
- **Y**ield measurable results
- **S**cale what works
- **T**rack everything

This is the same system we use to manage SEO for 20+ active clients. The difference: now you can access it directly, on your terms, at a fraction of the cost.

## Results From Real Businesses

**Dental practice in Austin, TX:** Went from page 3 to the local 3-pack for "dentist near me" in 11 weeks. Started with an audit, ordered a topical map, then built 22 content pages.

**HVAC company in Phoenix, AZ:** Increased organic leads by 340% in 6 months. Used the full stack: audit, topical map, 35 content pages, schema markup, and GBP optimization.

**Personal injury law firm in Atlanta, GA:** Captured 14 new "near me" keywords in the map pack within 90 days of GBP optimization and 15 new service area pages.

These aren't outliers. They're the expected outcome when you build the right pages, with the right structure, targeting the right keywords.

## Want Someone to Handle Everything?

Some businesses don't want to pick and choose deliverables. They want a team managing their entire local SEO presence -- strategy, execution, reporting, and ongoing optimization.

We do that too.

Our managed SEO service uses the exact same CATALYST system and 18-agent AI pipeline, but with a dedicated strategist overseeing everything. You get monthly reporting on geo-grid rankings, Share of Local Voice (SoLV), and Weighted Visibility Score (WVS).

## Start With a Topical Map

Not sure where to begin? A topical map tells you exactly what pages your site needs, what keywords to target, and what order to build them in.

It's the single best starting point for any local SEO campaign. And at $397, it pays for itself the moment you stop guessing and start building with a plan.

**See what your site needs. Pay only for what you want.**
