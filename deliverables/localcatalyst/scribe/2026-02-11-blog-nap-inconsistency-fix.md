NAP inconsistencies are one of the most common and most damaging local SEO problems. When your business Name, Address, and Phone number differ across the web, even in minor ways, it creates conflicting signals that weaken your local search visibility. The good news is that NAP inconsistencies are fixable. The process requires patience and systematic effort, but the ranking improvements that follow a thorough cleanup are among the most reliable returns in local SEO. Our [citation building services](/citation-building-services/) include professional NAP cleanup because we see firsthand how dramatically consistent business information improves geo-grid visibility scores.

This guide covers the most common causes of NAP inconsistencies and provides a clear, step-by-step process for fixing them.

## Common Causes of NAP Inconsistencies

Understanding how inconsistencies develop helps you prevent them from recurring after you clean them up.

### Business Moves or Address Changes

When a business relocates, the new address gets updated on the website and Google Business Profile, but dozens of directory listings, aggregator records, and older citations retain the old address. These outdated listings persist for years unless actively corrected.

### Phone Number Changes

Changing phone numbers, adding new lines, or switching from a personal cell to a business line creates the same propagation problem. Old phone numbers linger across directories and aggregator databases.

### Business Name Changes or Rebranding

If your business was formerly "Smith Heating & Cooling" and rebranded to "Smith HVAC Solutions," both versions of the name will exist across your citation profile until manually corrected.

### Inconsistent Data Entry

Different people entering business information on different platforms over time inevitably creates formatting variations. One person types "123 Main Street, Suite 200" while another types "123 Main St. #200." Both are technically correct but are not identical.

### Data Aggregator Conflicts

Data aggregators periodically push their records to downstream directories. If an aggregator has old data, it can overwrite corrections you made directly on individual platforms, reintroducing inconsistencies you thought you had fixed.

### Third-Party Edits and Scraped Data

Some platforms allow public suggestions for business information edits. Web scrapers also create automated business listings by pulling data from various sources across the web, sometimes combining information from different time periods or sources into a single inaccurate listing.

## The Step-by-Step Fix Process

### Step 1: Define Your Canonical NAP

Before correcting anything, establish the single authoritative version of your business information. This is your canonical NAP and every correction you make should bring listings into alignment with it.

Your canonical NAP should match your Google Business Profile exactly. Document it clearly:

```
Business Name: Smith HVAC Solutions
Address: 123 Main Street, Suite 200, Austin, TX 78701
Phone: (512) 555-0123
Website: https://www.smithhvac.com
```

Share this document with anyone who manages your business listings so there is zero ambiguity about the correct format.

### Step 2: Fix Data Aggregators First

This is the single most important step in the entire process and the one most businesses skip or do not know about.

Data aggregators feed your business information to hundreds of downstream directories. If your aggregator records are wrong, they will continuously overwrite your manual corrections on individual platforms. Fix the source before fixing the symptoms.

**Submit corrections to all three major aggregators:**

1. **Data Axle** (formerly InfoUSA): Submit or update your listing through their free business listing portal. Processing time: 4 to 8 weeks.
2. **Neustar Localeze**: Submit through their listing management service. Processing time: 4 to 8 weeks.
3. **Foursquare**: Claim your listing on Foursquare and update all business details. This is particularly important because Foursquare powers location data for Apple Maps, Uber, and thousands of other apps. Processing time: 2 to 4 weeks.

After submitting to aggregators, wait at least 8 weeks before re-auditing downstream directories. Many inconsistencies will self-correct as the new aggregator data propagates.

### Step 3: Fix Core Platforms

While aggregator corrections propagate, directly fix the platforms that carry the most weight and that you interact with most frequently.

**Priority order:**

1. **Google Business Profile:** Verify every field matches your canonical NAP. Check for pending "suggest an edit" submissions that could introduce errors.
2. **Bing Places:** Log in and update. Bing often pulls from its own data sources, so manual correction is important.
3. **Apple Business Connect:** Claim and correct your Apple Maps listing.
4. **Facebook Business Page:** Update the "About" section with your canonical NAP.
5. **Yelp:** Claim your listing if you have not already. Update all business details and verify they match.

### Step 4: Fix Major Directories

After core platforms, work through your other high-authority directory listings:

- Better Business Bureau
- Yellow Pages
- Industry-specific directories relevant to your business
- Chamber of Commerce listing
- LinkedIn Company Page

For each platform:
1. Log in to your claimed listing (or claim it if unclaimed).
2. Update all NAP fields to match your canonical format exactly.
3. While you are there, complete any empty profile fields (hours, categories, descriptions, photos).
4. Save and verify the update.

### Step 5: Remove or Merge Duplicate Listings

Duplicate listings are a special category of inconsistency that require more than just corrections. If you have two listings on the same platform, they compete with each other and confuse search engines.

**For each platform with duplicates:**
1. Identify the primary listing (usually the one with reviews and the longest history).
2. Ensure the primary listing has your canonical NAP.
3. Use the platform's duplicate reporting or merge tool to request removal of the secondary listing.
4. If no automated tool exists, contact the platform's support team directly.

### Step 6: Address Unclaimed and Uncontrolled Listings

Some citations exist on platforms where you have no account and no ability to directly edit the information. For these:

- **Use "suggest an edit" features** where available. Most platforms accept public correction suggestions.
- **Contact the platform directly** via email or support form. Provide documentation (utility bill, business license) proving your correct business information.
- **Accept that some citations cannot be corrected.** Low-authority directories with wrong information are frustrating but individually have minimal impact. Focus your energy on the sources that matter most.

### Step 7: Update Your Website

Ensure every instance of your NAP on your own website matches the canonical format:

- Header and footer
- Contact page
- About page
- Location pages
- Schema markup (check the JSON-LD in your page source code)

Your website should be the cleanest, most consistent representation of your business information anywhere on the web. For schema markup implementation guidance, see our article on [schema markup for local business](/blog/schema-markup-local-business/).

### Step 8: Verify Corrections After Propagation

Eight to twelve weeks after fixing your aggregator data, perform a follow-up audit to verify:

- Aggregator corrections have propagated to downstream directories
- Manual corrections on individual platforms have persisted (and not been overwritten by old aggregator data)
- No new inconsistencies have appeared from scraper-generated listings

Use the same citation auditing tools you used for the initial audit (Moz Local, BrightLocal, Whitespark) to scan for remaining issues. For a detailed audit methodology, see our [citation audit guide](/blog/citation-audit-guide/).

## Preventing Future Inconsistencies

After cleaning up your NAP, take these steps to prevent inconsistencies from returning:

**Document your canonical NAP** and ensure every team member who might create or update listings has access to it.

**Update all listings simultaneously** when any business detail changes. Create a checklist of every platform where your business is listed and work through it completely whenever you change your phone number, address, or business name.

**Claim all major listings** so you maintain control and can prevent third-party edits.

**Monitor quarterly** with citation scanning tools to catch new issues before they accumulate.

**Lock aggregator data** by maintaining active submissions with all three major aggregators. This reduces the chance of outdated third-party data overwriting your correct information.

Our [on-page SEO services](/on-page-seo-services/) include ongoing NAP monitoring as part of a comprehensive local SEO maintenance program.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does a full NAP cleanup take?

The initial correction process typically takes 2 to 4 weeks of active work, depending on how many listings you have. However, full propagation of aggregator corrections through downstream directories takes 8 to 12 weeks. Plan for a 3-month window from start to verified completion.

### Will fixing NAP inconsistencies immediately improve my rankings?

Ranking improvements typically appear 4 to 8 weeks after corrections are fully processed by search engines. The timeline depends on how severe your inconsistencies were and how many other local ranking factors are working in your favor. Businesses with severe inconsistencies (old addresses, wrong phone numbers on major platforms) often see the most dramatic improvements.

### What if an aggregator keeps reverting my corrections?

This can happen when multiple data sources conflict. If an aggregator reverts your correction, resubmit with supporting documentation. You may also need to correct the upstream source that the aggregator is pulling from. In persistent cases, a professional listing management service can provide direct relationships with aggregator data teams to resolve conflicts.

### Should I delete listings with wrong information that I cannot correct?

If you cannot correct a listing and it contains significantly wrong information (wrong address or phone number), request removal through the platform's support channels. An inaccurate listing that cannot be corrected is worse than no listing at all. However, for minor formatting differences on low-authority platforms, the effort to remove is usually not worth the marginal benefit.
