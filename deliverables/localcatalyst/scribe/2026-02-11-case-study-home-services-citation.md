## The Challenge

Brian Rocha, owner of Rocha Electric, had done a lot of things right. He had a modern, mobile-friendly website built two years prior. His Google Business Profile was claimed, verified, and reasonably well-optimized with photos, services, and a complete description. He had 68 reviews with a 4.7-star average --- a solid reputation by any measure.

And yet, Rocha Electric was stuck at position 12 for "electrician [city]" --- buried on page 2 of local results, invisible in the Map Pack, and watching competitors with fewer reviews and worse websites consistently outrank him.

Brian had tried two things before contacting LocalCatalyst: hiring a freelancer to "do SEO" (which mostly involved publishing blog posts nobody read) and running Google Ads at $1,500/month (which produced leads at $110 each --- barely profitable for residential electrical work).

The question that brought him to us was simple and frustrated: "What am I missing?"

## The Audit: Finding the Hidden Problem

Our CATALYST audit covered every dimension of Rocha Electric's local search presence --- technical SEO, on-page content, GBP optimization, backlink profile, review signals, and citation health.

The technical audit came back clean. The site was fast (1.8s LCP), properly structured, and mobile-optimized. On-page content was decent --- not exceptional, but not the bottleneck. GBP was well-maintained. Reviews were strong. Backlink profile was modest but not worse than competitors ranking above him.

**Then we ran the citation audit.**

The results were striking. Across 58 online directories, we found **73 citation inconsistencies** --- a number that immediately explained the ranking plateau.

### What Went Wrong

Rocha Electric had moved offices twice in seven years:

- **2019-2022:** Original office at 4812 Commerce Drive, Suite 110
- **2022-2024:** Second office at 7295 Industrial Parkway, Building C
- **2024-present:** Current office at 1103 Main Street

Each move created a layer of outdated information across the internet. Directories that had been set up or auto-generated during the first location were never updated when the business moved. Some directories were updated for the second move but not the third. The result was three different addresses scattered across the web.

On top of the address inconsistencies, the audit revealed:

- **2 different phone numbers:** The original office landline (disconnected in 2022) was still listed on 11 directories. The current number appeared on the rest.
- **3 business name variations:** "Rocha Electric," "Rocha Electric LLC," and "Rocha Electric Services" appeared across different platforms --- likely from different people filling out directory forms at different times.
- **7 duplicate listings:** Several directories had multiple entries for the business, sometimes with conflicting information between the duplicates.

### Why This Matters

NAP (Name, Address, Phone number) consistency is one of the foundational ranking signals in local search. When Google encounters conflicting information about a business across the web, it loses confidence in the accuracy of that business's data. The result is suppressed local rankings --- Google essentially hedges its bets by not prominently featuring a business it isn't sure about.

Brian's website and GBP were sending the right signals. But those signals were being contradicted by dozens of directory listings that told Google conflicting stories about who Rocha Electric was, where they were located, and how to reach them. It was like having a strong resume but three different addresses on your cover letters --- it creates doubt.

## The Fix: Systematic Citation Cleanup

Because the audit clearly identified citations as the primary ranking barrier, we designed a focused remediation plan. No content overhaul. No link building campaign. No website redesign. Just disciplined, systematic citation cleanup.

### Week 1-2: Full Audit & Documentation

- Completed comprehensive citation audit across 58 directories and data aggregators
- Documented all 73 inconsistencies in a master tracking spreadsheet with current status, incorrect data, correct data, and directory contact method
- Identified 7 duplicate listings for removal or merging
- Prioritized directories by domain authority and local search influence
- Established the canonical NAP:
  - **Name:** Rocha Electric
  - **Address:** 1103 Main Street, [City, State ZIP]
  - **Phone:** [Current number]

### Week 3-4: Corrections & Claims

**Data aggregator submissions:**
- Submitted corrected NAP data to the four major data aggregators (Neustar Localeze, Data Axle/Infogroup, Foursquare, and Yelp's data partnership) --- these feed information to hundreds of downstream directories

**Direct directory corrections (high priority):**
- Manually updated listings on 22 high-authority directories: Google Business Profile (already correct), Yelp, BBB, Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Yellow Pages, Manta, Superpages, CitySearch, and others
- Claimed 8 unclaimed listings where the business appeared but had never been verified by the owner
- Submitted duplicate removal requests to 7 directories

**Direct directory corrections (secondary tier):**
- Submitted correction requests to 19 additional directories with lower domain authority but consistent citation value
- Updated industry-specific directories (electrical contractor directories, trade association listings)

### Week 5-6: Rankings Begin to Move

Within days of the major aggregator corrections propagating, we observed the first ranking movement:

- **Day 32:** "Electrician [city]" moved from position 12 to position 8
- **Day 36:** Jumped to position 5
- **Day 39:** Appeared in the Map Pack at position 3 (local pack) for the first time
- **Day 42:** GBP impressions began a sharp upward trend
- **Day 45:** Stable Map Pack position #3; GBP impressions up 180% compared to the 30-day period before the engagement

## Client Testimonial

> "I spent two years and thousands of dollars trying to figure out why I couldn't crack the first page. Blog posts, backlinks, new website --- nothing moved the needle. LocalCatalyst ran their audit and told me the problem was my old business listings from two office moves ago. Honestly, I was skeptical that fixing directory listings could make that big of a difference. Forty-five days later, I'm in the Map Pack and my phone is ringing more than it has in years. Sometimes the answer really is that simple --- you just need someone who knows where to look."

## Key Takeaways

1. **NAP consistency is foundational --- and often overlooked.** Most businesses (and many SEO agencies) focus on content, links, and GBP optimization while ignoring the citation layer entirely. If your NAP data is inconsistent across the web, you've built your local SEO house on sand.

2. **Office moves create citation debt.** Every time a business changes its address, phone number, or even its legal name, a layer of outdated information accumulates across directories. Without deliberate cleanup, that debt compounds and silently suppresses rankings.

3. **Not every SEO problem requires a complex solution.** Rocha Electric didn't need a content overhaul, a link building campaign, or a website redesign. They needed 73 directory listings fixed. The right diagnosis leads to the right treatment.

4. **Data aggregators are the leverage point.** Correcting information at the four major data aggregators propagates changes to hundreds of downstream directories. This is where systematic citation cleanup starts.

5. **Citation cleanup results can be fast.** Unlike content-driven SEO strategies that take months to compound, citation cleanup removes a ranking barrier --- and once the barrier is gone, existing strengths (good GBP, strong reviews, solid website) can finally express themselves in rankings. Brian saw movement within 32 days.
