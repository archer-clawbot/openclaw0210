## Content Outline

### Introduction (200-250 words)
- Open with a problem: "Most SEO content sounds like it was written by a robot. Because it was."
- LocalCatalyst difference: strategic research + AI tools + human editing + SEO expertise
- Not just "content" — content with a job to do (rank, convert, build authority)
- This page explains the exact process we use for every client
- Transparency builds trust: you're not paying for mystery boxes

### H2: Why Our Content Writing Process Matters (300-350 words)

**H3: Content Is Your 24/7 Salesperson**
- Your website content works while you're with customers
- Every page has a job: attract the right searchers, answer their questions, convert them into leads
- Bad content = wasted money on pages that don't rank or convert
- Good content = steady stream of customers who found you on Google

**H3: Google Rewards Strategy, Not Just Words**
- Ranking isn't about word count or keyword stuffing
- Google looks for expertise, authority, and trustworthiness (E-E-A-T)
- Pages must match search intent (what searchers actually want)
- Topical authority (comprehensive coverage of your service area and expertise)
- LocalCatalyst approach: we build content systems, not random blog posts

**H3: You Deserve to Know What You're Paying For**
- SEO agencies love to be vague about "proprietary processes"
- We're pulling back the curtain
- This page shows you exactly how we research, plan, write, and optimize content
- No secrets, no black boxes

### H2: Our 7-Step Content Writing Process (1,200-1,400 words total)

**H3: Step 1 — Keyword Research & Search Intent Analysis (200-250 words)**
- We don't guess what people search for — we research it
- Tools we use: Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Search Console
- What we analyze:
  - Search volume (how many people search this per month?)
  - Keyword difficulty (how hard is it to rank?)
  - Search intent (what does the searcher want — info, or to hire someone?)
  - Current rankings (what's already ranking, and why?)
- Example: For a plumber, "emergency plumber near me" = high-value transactional intent
- We prioritize keywords that bring in customers, not just traffic
- Deliverable: keyword map for your entire site

**H3: Step 2 — Competitor & SERP Analysis (200-250 words)**
- We study what's already ranking on page 1
- Questions we answer:
  - What content types is Google ranking? (service pages, blog posts, videos, local listings?)
  - What topics do top pages cover?
  - How long are they?
  - What's missing that we can do better?
- We're not copying competitors — we're identifying gaps and opportunities
- Example: If competitors have thin 300-word pages, we create comprehensive 1,500-word guides
- If they ignore local landmarks, we weave in neighborhood-specific content
- Goal: create the *best* result for that search, not just another result

**H3: Step 3 — Topical Mapping & Content Planning (200-250 words)**
- Topical authority = comprehensive coverage of your expertise
- We map out content clusters around your core services
- Example for HVAC company:
  - Pillar page: "HVAC Services in [City]"
  - Supporting pages: "Furnace Repair," "AC Installation," "Duct Cleaning"
  - Blog posts: "How Often to Change HVAC Filters," "Signs Your Furnace Needs Repair"
  - Location pages: "[Service] in [Neighborhood]"
- Each piece links to related content (internal linking)
- Google sees you as an authority on HVAC, not just a site with random pages
- We plan 3-6 months of content ahead, aligned with seasonal demand

**H3: Step 4 — E-E-A-T Optimization (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) (250-300 words)**
- Google's quality standards: does this content demonstrate real expertise?
- How we build E-E-A-T into every page:
  
  **Experience:**
  - Include years in business, number of projects completed
  - Case studies and real customer scenarios (anonymized for privacy)
  - Before/after examples
  
  **Expertise:**
  - Mention certifications, licenses, training
  - Explain the "why" and "how," not just the "what"
  - Industry-specific terminology (explained in plain language)
  
  **Authoritativeness:**
  - Link to authoritative external sources (manufacturer sites, medical journals, local government)
  - Earn backlinks from local organizations, news sites, industry publications
  - Get featured on your Google Business Profile with reviews
  
  **Trustworthiness:**
  - Accurate, up-to-date information
  - Clear contact info, service areas, and business details
  - Professional tone, no hype or false promises
  - For medical/legal content: extra caution, qualifying language, "consult a professional" disclaimers

- E-E-A-T is especially critical for YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) industries: medical, legal, financial

**H3: Step 5 — Content Drafting (AI-Assisted + Human-Written) (200-250 words)**
- We use AI tools to speed up research and first drafts
- But AI doesn't write your final content — humans do
- Our process:
  1. AI generates a research-backed first draft based on keyword/outline
  2. Human editor rewrites for brand voice, local flavor, and readability
  3. Remove all AI "tells" (flowery language, filler phrases, robotic transitions)
  4. Inject personality and client-specific details
- What we NEVER publish:
  ❌ "In today's fast-paced world..."
  ❌ "When it comes to..."
  ❌ "Look no further than..."
  ❌ Generic, could-be-anyone content
- What we DO publish:
  ✅ Clear, specific, helpful content
  ✅ Conversational tone that matches your brand
  ✅ Local references (neighborhoods, landmarks, local challenges)

**H3: Step 6 — On-Page SEO Implementation (250-300 words)**
- Content is written — now we optimize it for Google
- Technical SEO elements we handle:
  
  **Title Tags & Meta Descriptions:**
  - Primary keyword in title (50-60 chars)
  - Compelling meta description (150-160 chars) that drives clicks
  
  **Header Hierarchy (H1, H2, H3):**
  - H1 = primary keyword + compelling benefit
  - H2s = section topics, with secondary keywords
  - H3s = subtopics for scannability
  
  **Internal Linking:**
  - 3-5 links to related service pages, location pages, or blog posts
  - Descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
  
  **Image Optimization:**
  - Descriptive file names (not IMG_1234.jpg)
  - Alt text for accessibility and SEO
  - Compressed for fast loading
  
  **Schema Markup:**
  - Local business schema
  - Service schema
  - FAQ schema
  - Review schema (where applicable)
  
  **URL Structure:**
  - Clean, keyword-rich URLs
  - `/services/hvac-repair-chicago/` not `/page?id=4782`
  
  **Keyword Placement:**
  - Primary keyword in first 100 words
  - Natural distribution throughout (never stuffed)

**H3: Step 7 — Human Editing, Quality Control & Publishing (200-250 words)**
- Every piece of content goes through editorial review
- Quality checklist:
  - ✅ Reads naturally (not keyword-stuffed)
  - ✅ Matches brand voice
  - ✅ Answers the searcher's question
  - ✅ Free of typos, grammar errors, formatting issues
  - ✅ All links work
  - ✅ Images display correctly

**H3: Local Expertise Baked In**
- We research your city, neighborhoods, service area

- Example: HVAC content mentions Chicago winters, not generic "cold weather"

**H3: Continuous Optimization**
- Content isn't "set it and forget it"
- We monitor performance: rankings, traffic, conversions

---

## FAQ Section (Schema-Ready)

**Q: How long does it take to write SEO content?**  
A: It depends on the content type. A service page typically takes 1-2 weeks (research, writing, editing, optimization). Blog posts take 3-5 days. We prioritize quality over speed — rushed content doesn't rank.

**Q: Do you use AI to write content?**  
A: We use AI tools to speed up research and first drafts, but every piece of content is heavily edited and rewritten by human writers. AI can't match brand voice or local expertise — that's where our team comes in.

**Q: What is E-E-A-T and why does it matter?**  
A: E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. It's Google's framework for evaluating content quality. We build E-E-A-T into every page by showcasing your credentials, linking to authoritative sources, and writing accurate, helpful content.

**Q: How do you optimize content for local search?**  
A: We include city and neighborhood names, reference local landmarks, create location-specific pages, and optimize your Google Business Profile. We also research local competitors to find ranking opportunities.

**Q: Can I review content before it's published?**  
A: Absolutely. We can set up a review process where you approve content before it goes live. Some clients prefer this for brand voice consistency; others trust us to publish and make edits as needed.

**Q: How often should I publish new content?**  
A: For most local businesses, 2-4 blog posts per month plus quarterly service page updates is a good cadence. Consistency matters more than volume. We create a content calendar aligned with your business goals and seasonal demand.

**Q: What's the difference between a blog post and a service page?**  
A: Service pages target high-intent, transactional keywords (people ready to hire). Blog posts target informational keywords (people researching). Both are important: blogs build authority and guide readers to service pages, where they convert.
