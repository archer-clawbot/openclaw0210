## Google Business Profile for Realtors: The Complete Optimization Guide

Your Google Business Profile is the most visible piece of digital real estate you own — and most realtors are barely using it. When a potential buyer or seller searches "real estate agent near me" or "realtor [city]," the Map Pack results that appear above all organic listings are powered by GBP data. The agents who appear in those three coveted positions get the calls and the clicks. Everyone else is invisible. As our [real estate SEO guide](/industries/real-estate-seo/) details, competing effectively in local search requires owning the assets that drive Map Pack visibility, and no asset is more important than your GBP.

The challenge for real estate agents is that GBP optimization for realtors involves unique considerations that other industries do not face. Category options are limited and confusing. The question of whether to list under a brokerage or as an individual practitioner creates policy minefields. Photo and content opportunities specific to real estate are routinely missed. This guide covers every element of GBP optimization for realtors, from initial setup to ongoing management. For a comprehensive look at GBP strategy across all industries, visit our [Google Business Profile management](/services/gbp-optimization/) service page.

## Setting Up Your Realtor GBP Correctly

### Individual Agent vs. Brokerage Profile

This is the first and most consequential decision. Google's guidelines allow both individual real estate agents and brokerages to have GBP profiles, but the rules are specific:

**Individual agents** can create a GBP if they operate as a distinct entity with direct client contact. The business name must be the agent's legal name or their publicly-recognized professional name — not "John Smith - Keller Williams" unless that is the legal name registered with the state. Adding the brokerage name to an individual agent profile violates Google's naming guidelines and risks suspension.

**Brokerages and teams** can have their own GBP listing for each physical office location. A brokerage with three offices can have three GBP profiles. A brokerage with one office should have one brokerage profile and individual agents can maintain their own separate profiles.

**The key rule:** Each profile must have a unique phone number and preferably a unique landing page. An agent profile cannot use the brokerage's main phone number, and a brokerage profile cannot list an individual agent's cell phone. Overlapping data between agent and brokerage profiles creates confusion in Google's system and can suppress both profiles.

### Category Selection

Your primary category is the single strongest ranking signal in your GBP. For most individual agents, the correct primary category is **"Real estate agent."** Do not choose "Real estate agency" unless you operate as a brokerage.

**Relevant secondary categories to add:**

- Real estate agency (if applicable)
- Real estate consultant
- Property management company (only if you offer property management)
- Real estate appraiser (only if you offer appraisals)

Do not add categories for services you do not provide. Google views irrelevant categories as a spam signal.

### Address and Service Area Configuration

If clients visit your office, list your address and enable location display. If you primarily meet clients at properties or their homes, you may configure as a service area business (SAB) with a hidden address and a defined service area.

Most agents benefit from showing their address. A visible address in the Map Pack builds trust and provides a proximity signal that can help you rank for searches near your office location. If your brokerage's office is in the center of your target market, displaying it is almost always the right choice.

## Optimizing Your Realtor GBP for Maximum Visibility

### Business Description

You have 750 characters to describe your business. Use every one of them. Include:

- Your service area (specific cities and neighborhoods)
- Your specializations (luxury homes, first-time buyers, investment properties, specific neighborhoods)
- Your credentials (years of experience, certifications, awards, production volume)
- Your value proposition (what makes you different from the 500 other agents in your market)

Do not stuff keywords unnaturally, but do include the terms potential clients search for. "Helping buyers and sellers in [City]'s [Neighborhood], [Neighborhood], and [Neighborhood] communities" is both natural and keyword-rich.

### Services Menu

GBP allows you to add a detailed services menu. Build it out completely:

- Buyer representation
- Seller representation / listing services
- Home valuation / comparative market analysis
- First-time homebuyer guidance
- Relocation assistance
- Investment property consultation
- New construction representation
- Luxury home sales
- Property management (if applicable)

Each service can include a description. Write unique, substantive descriptions rather than one-line placeholders. These descriptions contribute to Google's understanding of your relevance for specific queries.

### Photo Strategy for Real Estate GBPs

Photos are one of the most underutilized elements on realtor GBPs. Most agents upload a headshot and a logo and stop there. The agents who dominate in Map Pack results maintain active photo libraries that include:

- **Professional headshot and team photos** — high-quality, current images that convey professionalism
- **Office and workspace photos** — your office environment signals legitimacy
- **Sold property photos** — exterior and interior shots of homes you have successfully sold. This is your portfolio.
- **Neighborhood and community photos** — shots of local landmarks, parks, downtown areas, and streetscapes in the neighborhoods you serve. This reinforces local relevance.
- **Client celebration photos** — closing day photos with clients (with permission) demonstrate successful transactions and humanize your brand
- **Market activity photos** — open house signs, for-sale signs, staging in progress. These signal an active, producing agent.

Upload new photos at least monthly. GBP profiles with recent, regularly-updated photos signal activity to Google and receive more views and engagement from searchers.

### Google Business Profile Posts for Realtors

Posts appear directly on your GBP and provide a way to share timely content with searchers who find your profile. Most agents never post. That is a missed opportunity.

**Effective post types for realtors:**

- **Just listed / just sold** — showcase active inventory and recent closings. Include the property photo, neighborhood name, and key features.
- **Market updates** — monthly or quarterly market data for your area. "Average home prices in [Neighborhood] increased 4% this quarter" positions you as the market expert.
- **Neighborhood spotlights** — highlight a restaurant, park, event, or development in a community you serve. This builds local relevance signals.
- **Buyer and seller tips** — practical advice like "3 things first-time buyers should know about closing costs" or "How to prepare your home for sale this spring."
- **Open house announcements** — drive attendance to open houses and signal active listing inventory.

Post weekly. Consistency matters more than perfection. A simple post with a good photo and a useful update outperforms no post at all.

## Review Strategy for Realtors

Reviews are the second strongest ranking factor in Map Pack results, and they are also the primary trust signal for consumers choosing an agent. An agent with 85 reviews and a 4.8-star average will attract more inquiries than an agent with 8 reviews and a 5.0-star average.

### When to Ask for Reviews

The optimal time to request a review is at closing — when the emotion of a successful transaction is at its peak. But do not wait until closing is the only touchpoint. Consider requesting reviews:

- After a particularly helpful consultation
- After a successful home showing experience
- After helping a client navigate a difficult negotiation
- At the closing table (the most natural moment)
- One week after closing, as a follow-up

### How to Respond to Reviews

Respond to every review — positive and negative. Positive review responses should be personalized, referencing the specific transaction or experience. "Thank you for the kind words, Sarah! It was a pleasure helping you and Mark find your perfect home in Oak Park. Enjoy the new backyard!" is far more effective than "Thanks for the review!"

Negative reviews require prompt, professional responses that acknowledge the concern without being defensive. A well-handled negative review can actually build trust with future clients who see your professionalism under pressure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I have a GBP if I work from home and meet clients at properties?

Yes. You can set up your GBP as a service area business (SAB) with your home address hidden and a defined service area. You will not show an address pin on the map, but you will still appear in Map Pack results for searches within your service area. If your brokerage has an office, consider using the office address instead for a stronger proximity signal.

### How many Google reviews do I need to compete in the Map Pack?

There is no magic number, but we generally see agents become competitive for Map Pack positions once they reach 40-50 reviews with a 4.5+ star average. In highly competitive markets, top-ranking agents may have 150-300+ reviews. The key is consistent generation — aim for 4-6 new reviews per month and you will build a competitive review profile within a year.

### Should I respond to reviews that just leave a star rating with no text?

Yes. Even a brief "Thank you for the rating! We appreciate your trust." signals to Google that you are actively managing your profile. It also encourages future reviewers to leave more detailed feedback when they see that you engage with every review.
