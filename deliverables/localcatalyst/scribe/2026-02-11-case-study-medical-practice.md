## The Challenge

Meridian Health Associates is a multi-specialty medical practice with three providers — a family medicine physician, an internist, and a nurse practitioner — operating across two locations in a mid-sized metro area. They had been in practice for over a decade, built a loyal patient base through word-of-mouth, and delivered excellent care. But their online presence told a different story.

When they came to LocalCatalyst, they were effectively invisible in local search. Searching "doctor near me" or "family doctor [city]" from anywhere in their service area returned hospital system websites, Zocdoc listings, and Healthgrades profiles — but not Meridian Health. Their own website appeared on page 3 at best.

**The specific problems:**

**Google Business Profile.** Their GBP was claimed but barely populated. Missing specialties, no insurance information, no appointment booking link, generic stock photos, no posts in over a year. GBP completeness scored at 35% against our audit criteria. Both locations had profiles, but neither was optimized.

**Reviews.** Twelve Google reviews with a 3.8-star average. For a practice that had served thousands of patients over a decade, this was a tiny, unrepresentative sample — skewed by the handful of unhappy patients who bothered to leave feedback. Their competitors averaged 80-150 reviews with ratings above 4.5.

**Website.** Their website was a dated WordPress theme with five thin pages. Load time averaged 4.2 seconds (LCP), there was no schema markup, no structured service content, and no location-specific optimization. Service pages consisted of single paragraphs describing each specialty.

**Citations.** A citation audit uncovered 47 inconsistencies across directories — wrong phone numbers, outdated addresses from a location move two years prior, and conflicting business name variations. These inconsistencies were actively confusing Google about the practice's identity and locations.

**Competitive landscape.** The local market included two hospital systems with significant SEO investment and domain authorities above 80. Zocdoc and Healthgrades dominated the first page for nearly every medical search in the area. Competing independent practices had invested in their online presence and held Map Pack positions that Meridian was nowhere near.

The practice was losing new patients every day — not to better doctors, but to better-optimized competitors.

## The Strategy

We deployed our CATALYST methodology across a focused 90-day sprint, sequencing every action by expected impact.

### Month 1: Audit and Foundation (Weeks 1-4)

**Week 1-2: Comprehensive Audit**

We conducted a full local SEO audit covering both locations: geo-grid ranking analysis across their service area, GBP health assessment, citation audit, backlink analysis, competitor benchmarking, and technical site audit. The audit identified 47 citation inconsistencies, 14 technical issues suppressing crawlability and page speed, zero medical schema markup, and a GBP completeness gap of 57 percentage points.

**Week 2-3: GBP Overhaul**

We rebuilt both Google Business Profiles from the ground up. Primary and secondary categories were optimized for each location's specific specialty mix. We added comprehensive service listings with descriptions matching patient search behavior — "annual physical exam," "diabetes management," "joint pain treatment" — not just clinical specialty names. Insurance information for all 12 accepted plans was added. Appointment booking links were integrated with their existing scheduling platform. Professional photos of both offices, all three providers, and the care team were uploaded. A weekly posting cadence was established, starting with provider introductions and new patient welcome content.

GBP completeness moved from 35% to 92% by end of month 1.

**Week 3-4: Technical Remediation**

Our [technical SEO](/services/seo-audit/technical-seo-audit/) team addressed every issue identified in the audit. Image compression and lazy loading reduced LCP from 4.2 seconds to 1.8 seconds. We implemented proper heading hierarchy, fixed crawl errors, added XML sitemap, configured robots.txt, and deployed MedicalBusiness schema, Physician schema, and FAQPage schema across the site. HTTPS was already in place, but mixed content issues were resolved.

**Week 4: Citation Cleanup**

We corrected all 47 citation inconsistencies — updating business name, address, and phone number across every directory, data aggregator, and medical-specific platform. Consistent NAP data was pushed to the four major data aggregators (Data Axle, Neustar Localeze, Foursquare, Factual) to propagate corrections downstream. New citations were built on 15 medical-specific directories including Healthgrades, Vitals, Doximity, and state medical board listings.

### Month 2: Growth (Weeks 5-8)

**Review Generation Launch**

We implemented a multi-touchpoint review generation system: post-appointment email and SMS sequences sent within 2 hours of checkout, front desk scripting for in-person requests, and provider-specific review request cards. All communications were HIPAA-compliant — no reference to specific conditions or treatments, no PHI in follow-up messages.

Results were immediate. From 12 reviews and a 3.8-star average, the practice reached 38 reviews with a 4.7-star average by end of month 2. The volume of positive feedback from happy patients overwhelmed the small number of older negative reviews, and the new reviews contained keyword-rich content — patients naturally mentioned "friendly staff," "family doctor," "short wait times," and specific services.

**Content Optimization**

We rewrote six service pages from thin paragraphs to comprehensive, patient-focused content averaging 1,200 words each. Each page was optimized for specific search terms, included FAQ sections with schema markup, featured provider credentials for E-E-A-T signals, and linked to relevant condition information. Topics included family medicine, internal medicine, preventive care, chronic disease management, urgent care services, and women's health.

**Local Link Building**

We identified and secured backlinks from local health organizations, a community wellness newsletter, the chamber of commerce, and two local business directories with editorial review processes. Each link reinforced the practice's local authority and healthcare expertise.

### Month 3: Acceleration (Weeks 9-12)

**Expanded Content**

We published condition-specific guides for the practice's most commonly searched services — diabetes management, hypertension, annual wellness exams, and sports physicals. Each guide was authored by the relevant provider, included proper medical citations, and targeted long-tail keywords that patients were actively searching.

**Continued Review Generation**

The review generation system continued building momentum. By day 90, the practice had 58 Google reviews with a 4.7-star average — a 383% increase in review count with a nearly full-star improvement in rating.

**GBP Optimization Refinement**

Based on GBP Insights data from the first two months, we refined category selection, adjusted service descriptions for higher-performing search terms, and increased posting frequency to twice weekly with health tip content, seasonal reminders, and provider spotlights.

## The Results

After 90 days, the transformation was comprehensive.

**Rankings.** The practice went from 3 keywords in the top 5 to 23 — including Map Pack positions for "family doctor [city]," "doctor near me" (from both location areas), "internal medicine [city]," "annual physical [city]," and 18 additional high-intent medical search terms. Geo-grid analysis showed Map Pack visibility across 70% of their service area, up from less than 10%.

**Patient acquisition.** New patient bookings from organic search increased from 27 per month to 77 per month — a 185% increase. These were new patients booking directly through the website or calling from Google search results, not referrals or returning patients.

**GBP performance.** Monthly GBP interactions — calls, direction requests, website clicks, and booking actions — increased from 340 to 1,400, a 312% increase. The practice's GBP was now functioning as a primary patient acquisition channel rather than a dormant listing.

**Reputation.** From 12 reviews at 3.8 stars to 58 reviews at 4.7 stars. The practice's online reputation now accurately reflected the quality of care they had been delivering for over a decade.

**Technical health.** Website performance improved dramatically — LCP from 4.2s to 1.8s, zero crawl errors, comprehensive schema markup, and a content library that established the practice as a local healthcare authority.

**Month-by-month progression:**

| Metric | Baseline | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Top-5 keywords | 3 | 7 | 14 | 23 |
| Map Pack terms | 0 | 4 | 9 | 15 |
| New patient bookings | 27 | 34 | 52 | 77 |
| Google reviews | 12 | 15 | 38 | 58 |
| Star rating | 3.8 | 3.9 | 4.5 | 4.7 |
| GBP interactions | 340 | 520 | 890 | 1,400 |
| LCP (seconds) | 4.2 | 1.8 | 1.7 | 1.6 |
