# How We Write Content That Ranks Your Business on Google

**Meta Title:** How We Write Content That Ranks & Converts | LocalCatalyst  
**Meta Description:** Go behind the scenes of our content writing process: from keyword research to topical mapping, search intent analysis, E-E-A-T optimization, and human editing.

Most SEO content sounds like it was written by a robot. Because it was.

You've seen it: generic blog posts that could be about any business in any city. Keyword-stuffed service pages that read like instruction manuals. Content that ranks nowhere because it doesn't answer what people are actually searching for.

At LocalCatalyst, we do it differently. We combine strategic research, AI-assisted drafting, human editing, and SEO expertise to create content that actually works — content that ranks *and* converts.

This isn't content for content's sake. Every page we write has a job to do: attract the right searchers, answer their questions, and convert them into leads.

This page pulls back the curtain on our exact process. You're not paying for mystery boxes or "proprietary methods." You're paying for strategy, research, writing, and optimization — and you deserve to know what that looks like.

## Why Our Content Writing Process Matters

### Content Is Your 24/7 Salesperson

Your website content works while you're busy with customers. While you're on a job site, in a consultation, or closed for the night, your website is answering questions and convincing people to call you.

Every page has a job:
- **Attract** the right searchers (people in your service area looking for what you offer)
- **Answer** their questions (why should I hire you? Are you local? Do you handle my specific problem?)
- **Convert** them into leads (call, book, request a quote)

Bad content means wasted money. Pages that don't rank or convert are dead weight.

Good content means a steady stream of customers who found you on Google, read your site, and decided you're the right choice.

### Google Rewards Strategy, Not Just Words

Ranking on Google isn't about word count or keyword stuffing. Google looks for three things:

1. **Expertise, authority, and trustworthiness** (E-E-A-T) — Does this content demonstrate real knowledge and experience?
2. **Search intent match** — Does this page give searchers what they actually want?
3. **Topical authority** — Does this site comprehensively cover the topic, or is it a random collection of pages?

LocalCatalyst builds content systems, not random blog posts. Every page fits into a larger strategy designed to establish you as the local expert in your field.

### You Deserve to Know What You're Paying For

Too many SEO agencies hide behind vague language like "proprietary processes" or "advanced algorithms." That's code for "we don't want to explain what we're doing."

We're pulling back the curtain. This page shows you exactly how we research, plan, write, and optimize content. No secrets. No black boxes. Just a clear, repeatable process that gets results.

## Our 7-Step Content Writing Process

### Step 1 — Keyword Research & Search Intent Analysis

We don't guess what people search for. We research it.

**Tools we use:**
- Google Keyword Planner
- Ahrefs
- SEMrush
- Google Search Console

**What we analyze:**
- **Search volume** — How many people search this per month?
- **Keyword difficulty** — How hard is it to rank for this keyword?
- **Search intent** — What does the searcher want: information, or to hire someone?
- **Current rankings** — What's already ranking on page one, and why?

**Example:** For a plumber, "emergency plumber near me" has transactional intent (high-value). "How to unclog a drain" has informational intent (lower conversion value, but builds trust).

We prioritize keywords that bring in customers, not just traffic. A thousand visitors who bounce is worthless. A hundred visitors who call you is gold.

**Deliverable:** A keyword map for your entire site, organized by search intent and business priority.

---

### Step 2 — Competitor & SERP Analysis

We study what's already ranking on page one of Google. This tells us what Google considers a good result for that search.

**Questions we answer:**
- What content types is Google ranking? (service pages, blog posts, videos, local listings?)
- What topics do the top pages cover?
- How long are they? (300 words? 1,500 words? 3,000 words?)
- What's missing that we can do better?

We're not copying competitors. We're identifying gaps and opportunities.

**Example:** If the top-ranking HVAC companies in your area have thin 300-word service pages, we create comprehensive 1,500-word guides that cover everything a homeowner needs to know about furnace repair.

If competitors ignore local landmarks and neighborhoods, we weave in neighborhood-specific content that proves you're actually local.

**Goal:** Create the *best* result for that search, not just another result.

---

### Step 3 — Topical Mapping & Content Planning

Topical authority means comprehensive coverage of your expertise. Google wants to see that you're an expert in your field, not just someone with a few random pages.

**How we build topical authority:**

We map out content clusters around your core services.

**Example for an HVAC company:**
- **Pillar page:** "HVAC Services in [City]"
- **Service pages:** "Furnace Repair," "AC Installation," "Duct Cleaning," "Thermostat Replacement"
- **Blog posts:** "How Often Should You Change Your HVAC Filter?" "Signs Your Furnace Needs Repair," "When to Replace vs. Repair Your Air Conditioner"
- **Location pages:** "Furnace Repair in [Neighborhood]," "AC Installation in [Suburb]"

Each piece links to related content (internal linking). Google sees you as an authority on HVAC, not just a website with disconnected pages.

We plan content 3-6 months ahead, aligned with seasonal demand. For HVAC, that means furnace content in fall, AC content in spring.

**Result:** A content ecosystem where every page supports every other page. Visitors find answers and move deeper into your site. Google sees comprehensive expertise.

### Step 4 — E-E-A-T Optimization (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness)

E-E-A-T is Google's quality framework. It answers one question: *Does this content demonstrate real expertise?*

This is especially critical for YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) industries — medical, legal, financial, and home services that affect safety.

**How we build E-E-A-T into every page:**

#### Experience
- Include how long you've been in business
- Mention the number of projects or patients you've served
- Use case studies and real customer scenarios (anonymized for privacy)
- Before/after examples where applicable

#### Expertise
- Highlight certifications, licenses, and training
- Explain the "why" and "how," not just the "what"
- Use industry-specific terminology (but explain it in plain language)
- Reference manufacturer partnerships, specialized training, or advanced techniques

#### Authoritativeness
- Link to authoritative external sources (manufacturer sites, medical journals, local government pages)
- Earn backlinks from local organizations, news sites, and industry publications
- Get featured on your Google Business Profile with customer reviews
- Showcase awards, certifications, and memberships in professional organizations

#### Trustworthiness
- Provide accurate, up-to-date information (no exaggerations or false promises)
- Display clear contact info, service areas, and business details
- Use a professional tone without hype
- For medical/legal content: include qualifying language ("may help," "designed to," "consult your healthcare provider")

**Example:** A page about dental implants doesn't just say "we offer dental implants." It explains what implants are, who's a good candidate, how the procedure works, what certifications your dentist has, and links to manufacturer information. That's E-E-A-T in action.

---

### Step 5 — Content Drafting (AI-Assisted + Human-Written)

We use AI tools to speed up research and first drafts. But AI doesn't write your final content — humans do.

**Our process:**
1. **AI generates a first draft** based on keyword research, outline, and competitor analysis
2. **Human editor rewrites** for brand voice, local flavor, and readability
3. **Remove AI "tells"** — flowery language, filler phrases, robotic transitions
4. **Inject personality** and client-specific details that AI can't know

**What we NEVER publish:**
- ❌ "In today's fast-paced world..."
- ❌ "When it comes to [topic]..."
- ❌ "Look no further than..."
- ❌ "We pride ourselves on..."
- ❌ Generic content that could be about anyone, anywhere

**What we DO publish:**
- ✅ Clear, specific, helpful content
- ✅ Conversational tone that matches your brand
- ✅ Local references (neighborhoods, landmarks, local challenges)
- ✅ Content that sounds like a knowledgeable human wrote it, not a robot

AI is a tool, not a replacement. It speeds up research. Humans make it great.

### Step 6 — On-Page SEO Implementation

Content is written. Now we optimize it for Google.

**Technical SEO elements we handle:**

#### Title Tags & Meta Descriptions
- Primary keyword in title tag (50-60 characters)
- Compelling meta description (150-160 characters) that drives clicks
- Example: "Emergency Plumber in Chicago | 24/7 Service | Call Now"

#### Header Hierarchy (H1, H2, H3)
- **H1** = Primary keyword + compelling benefit
- **H2s** = Section topics, include secondary keywords
- **H3s** = Subtopics for scannability
- Clean structure makes content easy to read and easy for Google to understand

#### Internal Linking
- 3-5 links to related service pages, location pages, or blog posts
- Descriptive anchor text (not "click here")
- Example: "Learn more about our furnace repair services" (links to furnace repair page)

#### Image Optimization
- Descriptive file names (`hvac-technician-chicago.jpg`, not `IMG_1234.jpg`)
- Alt text for accessibility and SEO
- Compressed images for fast loading (page speed affects rankings)

#### Schema Markup
- **Local business schema** (name, address, phone, hours)
- **Service schema** (describes what you offer)
- **FAQ schema** (makes your FAQs eligible for rich results)
- **Review schema** (displays star ratings in search results)

Schema tells Google exactly what your page is about. It's how you get rich results (star ratings, FAQs, business details) in search.

#### URL Structure
- Clean, keyword-rich URLs
- `/services/hvac-repair-chicago/` ✅
- `/page?id=4782` ❌

#### Keyword Placement
- Primary keyword in the first 100 words
- Natural distribution throughout (never stuffed)
- Variations and synonyms (Google understands context)

### Step 7 — Human Editing, Quality Control & Publishing

Every piece of content goes through editorial review before it goes live.

**Quality checklist:**
- ✅ Reads naturally (not keyword-stuffed or robotic)
- ✅ Matches your brand voice
- ✅ Answers the searcher's question completely
- ✅ Free of typos, grammar errors, and formatting issues
- ✅ All links work and open correctly
- ✅ Images display properly on desktop and mobile
- ✅ Mobile-friendly formatting (short paragraphs, scannable headers)
- ✅ Passes plagiarism check (100% original content)

**For medical, legal, or financial clients:** Additional compliance review to ensure accuracy and appropriate disclaimers.

**Client review (optional):** Some clients want to approve content before it goes live. We can set up a review process that fits your workflow.

**Publishing schedule:** Aligned with seasonal demand and your content calendar. HVAC furnace content goes live in fall. AC content in spring.

**Post-publish monitoring:** We track rankings, traffic, and conversions. Underperforming pages get refreshed with updated information, better keywords, or improved CTAs.

## What Makes LocalCatalyst Content Different

### We Write for Humans First, Search Engines Second

Content must convert, not just rank.

We use clear, jargon-free language. Problem-solution structure. Calls to action that guide next steps.

A service page isn't just keyword-optimized — it's written to convince someone to call you.

### Every Page Has a Purpose

We don't create "content for content's sake."

**Service pages** = Convert visitors into customers  
**Blog posts** = Build authority + guide readers to services  
**Location pages** = Capture "near me" searches  
**Google Business Profile posts** = Local visibility + immediate action

If a page doesn't have a clear job, we don't write it.

### Local Expertise Baked In

We research your city, neighborhoods, and service area. We reference local landmarks, events, and challenges.

"Serving [Neighborhood]" isn't just a line we drop in. We prove it with local content.

**Example:** HVAC content for a Chicago company mentions brutal winters, lake-effect weather, and older homes with outdated heating systems. That's local expertise. Generic "cold weather" content doesn't cut it.

### Continuous Optimization

Content isn't "set it and forget it."

We monitor performance: rankings, traffic, conversions. Underperforming pages get refreshed with updated info, better keywords, improved CTAs.

Google loves updated content. We keep it fresh.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does it take to write SEO content?**  
A: It depends on the content type. A service page typically takes 1-2 weeks from research through editing and optimization. Blog posts take 3-5 days. We prioritize quality over speed — rushed content doesn't rank or convert.

**Q: Do you use AI to write content?**  
A: We use AI tools to speed up research and create first drafts, but every piece of content is heavily edited and rewritten by human writers. AI can't match your brand voice, understand local nuance, or know your business the way a human editor can. AI is a tool. Humans make it great.

**Q: What is E-E-A-T and why does it matter?**  
A: E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. It's Google's framework for evaluating content quality. We build E-E-A-T into every page by showcasing your credentials, referencing authoritative sources, demonstrating real experience, and writing accurate, helpful content. High E-E-A-T means better rankings.

**Q: How do you optimize content for local search?**  
A: We include city and neighborhood names naturally throughout the content. We reference local landmarks, create location-specific pages, and optimize your Google Business Profile. We also research local competitors to find ranking opportunities and write content that proves you're not just *in* the area — you're *from* the area.

**Q: Can I review content before it's published?**  
A: Absolutely. We can set up a review process where you approve content before it goes live. Some clients prefer this for brand voice consistency or compliance. Others trust us to publish and make edits as needed. Either way works.

**Q: How often should I publish new content?**  
A: For most local businesses, 2-4 blog posts per month plus quarterly service page updates is a good cadence. Consistency matters more than volume. We create a content calendar aligned with your business goals and seasonal demand (HVAC content in fall/spring, tax prep content in winter, etc.).

**Q: What's the difference between a blog post and a service page?**  
A: Service pages target high-intent, transactional keywords — people who are ready to hire someone. Blog posts target informational keywords — people who are researching. Both are important. Blogs build authority and guide readers to service pages, where they convert into customers.
