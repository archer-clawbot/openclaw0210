An attorney's reputation has always been the foundation of client acquisition. Referrals, courtroom presence, and professional standing drove legal business for decades. Today, that reputation lives online, and a single negative review on Google or Avvo can override years of professional excellence in the eyes of a prospective client. Within our [law firm SEO](/industries/law-firm-seo/) framework, reputation management is not a vanity exercise but a direct revenue driver that determines whether search visibility converts into signed retainers.

LocalCatalyst's [reputation management services](/reputation-management-services/) for attorneys address the ethical complexities and platform-specific challenges that make legal reputation management distinct from any other industry.

## Why Reputation Matters More for Attorneys

Legal services are among the most high-stakes purchasing decisions consumers make. When someone searches for a criminal defense attorney or a divorce lawyer, they are facing a situation that directly affects their freedom, finances, or family. This creates an outsized reliance on social proof:

- **79% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations** when selecting a service provider, and the figure is higher for high-stakes services like legal representation.
- **Star rating acts as a filter.** Prospective clients scanning the local pack or Google Maps results use star ratings to immediately eliminate firms below a certain threshold, typically 4.0 stars.
- **Review recency matters.** A firm with 50 reviews that are all 2+ years old appears less active and trustworthy than a competitor with 30 reviews that include recent feedback from the past few months.
- **Review content influences keyword relevance.** Google's local algorithm considers review text when determining relevance. Reviews that mention specific practice areas ("helped me with my custody case") reinforce the firm's relevance for those search terms.

A strong reputation profile does not just influence consumer behavior. It directly impacts local search rankings. Review signals, including quantity, velocity, diversity, and rating, constitute a significant local ranking factor.

## Ethical Review Generation for Attorneys

Generating reviews as an attorney requires navigating ethical obligations that do not apply to most other businesses. Bar advertising rules, client confidentiality duties, and the inherent power dynamics of attorney-client relationships all constrain how and when firms can request reviews.

### Timing: After Case Resolution

The appropriate time to request a review is after the legal matter has concluded. Requesting reviews during active representation creates ethical problems:

- The client may feel pressured to leave a positive review to maintain the attorney's goodwill during their ongoing case
- The review may inadvertently disclose details of an active legal matter
- A negative review during representation could compromise the attorney-client relationship at a critical time

Best practice is to incorporate a review request into the case closure process, after the final outcome is communicated and the client's obligations to the firm are settled.

### Method: Neutral, No-Pressure Communication

Effective review requests for law firms use neutral language delivered through low-pressure channels:

- **Post-case email sequence:** A brief email thanking the client for their trust and inviting them to share their experience on Google. Include a direct link to the review prompt.
- **Follow-up letter or card:** For practice areas with older demographics (estate planning, probate), a physical letter with clear review instructions can be effective.
- **In-person request at final meeting:** When closing a case in person, a brief mention that online reviews help the firm serve more clients like them. No written materials handed across the desk during this conversation; follow up with an email afterward.

Never offer any form of compensation or incentive for reviews. This violates both Google's policies and bar ethics rules. Similarly, never screen clients or request reviews only from those likely to leave positive feedback; selective solicitation violates Google's review guidelines.

### Volume and Velocity Targets

For most law firms, a sustainable review generation cadence looks like:

- **Small firms (1-3 attorneys):** 2-4 new reviews per month
- **Mid-size firms (4-10 attorneys):** 5-10 new reviews per month
- **Large firms (10+ attorneys):** 10-20 new reviews per month, distributed across practice areas

Consistency matters more than volume. A steady stream of reviews over months signals ongoing client satisfaction, while a sudden burst of 20 reviews in a week can trigger Google's spam detection and review filtering.

## Handling Negative Reviews

Negative reviews are inevitable in legal practice. Even the most skilled attorney cannot satisfy every client, and the emotional intensity of legal matters magnifies dissatisfaction. How a firm handles negative reviews is often more important than the reviews themselves.

### Bar Rules on Responding to Reviews

Attorneys face a unique constraint when responding to negative reviews: **client confidentiality survives the attorney-client relationship.** Even if a former client publicly shares details of their case in a review, the attorney generally cannot confirm, deny, or elaborate on those details in a public response.

Appropriate response framework:

- **Acknowledge without confirming.** "We take client feedback seriously and strive to provide excellent representation in every matter."
- **Offer offline resolution.** "We would welcome the opportunity to discuss your concerns. Please contact our office directly at [phone number]."
- **Avoid defensive language.** Never argue facts, challenge the reviewer's account, or imply the reviewer is being dishonest. Even if the review is inaccurate, a combative response reflects poorly on the firm.
- **Document everything.** If a review contains defamatory statements or clearly comes from someone who was never a client, document the review and pursue removal through Google's content policies.

### When to Seek Review Removal

Google will remove reviews that violate its content policies, including:

- Reviews from individuals who were never clients of the firm
- Reviews that contain hate speech, threats, or personally identifiable information
- Reviews that are clearly spam or posted by competitors
- Reviews that violate conflict of interest rules (e.g., opposing counsel reviewing your firm)

Flag violating reviews through Google Business Profile's review management tools. For reviews that constitute defamation, consult with a colleague who handles defamation claims about potential legal remedies, though litigation over reviews should be a last resort given the public relations risks.

## Monitoring Legal Review Platforms

Attorneys must monitor reputation across multiple platforms, not just Google:

- **Google Business Profile:** The most visible review platform and the one most directly tied to local search rankings
- **Avvo:** Widely used by legal consumers. Avvo's proprietary rating system and client reviews both influence prospective client perceptions
- **Yelp:** Significant presence in some markets, particularly for consumer-facing practice areas like family law and personal injury
- **Martindale-Hubbell:** Peer reviews on Martindale carry weight with both consumers and referral sources
- **Facebook:** Law firm Facebook pages accumulate reviews that appear in search results and influence consumer trust
- **Better Business Bureau:** BBB ratings and complaint records appear prominently in branded searches for many firms

Monitoring tools should track new reviews across all platforms and alert the firm within 24 hours of a new review being posted. Rapid response, particularly to negative reviews, demonstrates responsiveness and limits the time a negative review sits unanswered.

## Reputation's Direct Impact on Client Acquisition

Reputation management connects directly to revenue through measurable pathways:

- **Local pack click-through rate:** Firms with higher star ratings in the local 3-pack receive disproportionately more clicks than lower-rated competitors in the same pack
- **Conversion rate on firm website:** Visitors who arrive at a firm's website after reading positive reviews convert to consultation requests at higher rates
- **Referral reinforcement:** When a friend or colleague refers someone to a law firm, the prospective client almost always searches the firm online before calling. A strong review profile confirms the referral; a weak one undermines it
- **Competitive differentiation:** In markets where multiple firms offer similar services at similar price points, online reputation becomes the primary differentiator

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can an attorney ask a client to remove or edit a negative review?

Attorneys should not pressure clients to modify or remove reviews. Doing so could be interpreted as coercive, particularly given the power dynamics inherent in attorney-client relationships. If a client voluntarily offers to update or remove a review after a concern has been addressed, the attorney may explain how to do so, but should not initiate the request.

### How do I respond to a review that reveals confidential case details?

Do not confirm or expand upon any case details in your public response, even if the reviewer has already disclosed them. Your confidentiality obligation survives the client's own disclosure. Respond with a general statement about your commitment to client service and invite the reviewer to contact the office directly. If the review reveals information that could harm a third party, consult your state bar's ethics hotline for guidance.
