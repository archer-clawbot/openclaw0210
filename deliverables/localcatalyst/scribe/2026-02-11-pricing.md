## We Believe You Should Know What You're Paying For

Most SEO agencies hide their pricing. They want you on a call before they'll tell you what anything costs. That's a red flag — and it's not how we operate.

Below is exactly what each plan includes, what it costs, and who it's built for. No asterisks, no "starting at" qualifiers, no surprise fees buried in fine print. If you have questions after reading this page, **[contact us](/contact/)** and we'll answer them directly.

Every plan is powered by our [CATALYST methodology](/about/our-process/) — the same systematic framework, tailored to different levels of scope and aggression.

## Starter — $750/month

**Best for:** Single-location businesses just getting started with local SEO.

You know you need to show up in Google, but you're not sure where to begin. The Starter plan builds the foundation — optimizing your Google Business Profile, establishing citations, and fixing the most critical issues holding your rankings back.

### What's Included:

- **Google Business Profile optimization & monthly management** — Full setup using our 5-SPEC framework, plus ongoing management
- **Citation building** — Listings submitted and verified across 25 authoritative directories
- **Monthly GBP posts** — 4 posts/month to keep your profile active and engaging
- **Review monitoring & response templates** — We track incoming reviews and provide professional response templates
- **Basic on-page optimization** — Title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and content optimization for 5 key pages
- **Monthly ranking report** — Clear report showing keyword positions, GBP performance, and progress
- **Dedicated account manager** — A real person you can call, not a support ticket queue

The Starter plan is designed for businesses in moderately competitive markets that need a solid SEO foundation without the full scope of an aggressive campaign.

## Growth — $1,500/month

> **RECOMMENDED** — This is our most popular plan and the best value for businesses serious about dominating their local market.

**Best for:** Established businesses ready to outrank their competition and own their local market.

You have a business worth investing in. You're ready to go beyond the basics and execute a complete local SEO strategy — technical optimization, content creation, link building, and aggressive GBP management.

### Everything in Starter, Plus:

- **Full [technical SEO audit](/seo-audit-services/) & implementation** — 200+ ranking factors analyzed, all critical and high-priority issues resolved
- **Ongoing [on-page optimization](/on-page-seo-services/)** — 15 pages optimized and continuously refined

The Growth plan is the sweet spot for most local businesses. It's comprehensive enough to drive significant ranking improvements while maintaining a sustainable monthly investment.

## Domination — $3,000/month

**Best for:** Multi-location businesses, highly competitive markets, or businesses that want maximum visibility in the shortest time possible.

You're not just trying to rank. You're trying to own your market. The Domination plan is our most aggressive offering — more content, more links, more locations, and faster execution.

### Everything in Growth, Plus:

- **Multi-location [GBP management](/gbp-optimization-services/)** — Full 5-SPEC optimization and management for multiple locations
- **Expanded content creation** — 4 blog posts/month + 2 location-specific or service-area pages
- **Aggressive [link building](/link-building-services/)** — 10-15 quality backlinks per month
- **Full [reputation management](/reputation-management-services/)** — Proactive review generation, response management, and sentiment monitoring
- **Landing page design & optimization** — Custom landing pages built for high-converting keywords and service areas
- **Conversion rate optimization** — Ongoing testing and improvement of calls-to-action, forms, and page layouts to turn more visitors into leads
- **Priority support** — Faster response times and direct access to senior strategists
- **Bi-weekly strategy calls** — Twice-monthly calls for closer strategic alignment
- **Quarterly comprehensive audit** — Full re-audit every 90 days to identify new opportunities and measure total progress

The Domination plan is built for businesses in competitive markets — think personal injury lawyers in major metros, multi-location dental groups, or HVAC companies covering large service areas. If your competitors are investing heavily in SEO, this plan matches and exceeds their effort.

## What Every Plan Includes

Regardless of which tier you choose, every LocalCatalyst engagement comes with:

- **CATALYST methodology audit** — Your engagement starts with a thorough analysis of your current visibility, competitive landscape, and opportunities
- **Transparent monthly reporting** — Clear, jargon-free reports that connect activities to outcomes
- **Direct communication** — You talk to the person doing the work, not a middleman
- **No long-term contracts** — Month-to-month after a 90-day minimum engagement
- **90-day performance commitment** — If you don't see measurable improvement in 90 days, we make it right

We don't nickel-and-dime. There are no setup fees, no hidden charges, and no surprise invoices. The monthly price you see is the monthly price you pay.

---

## Need Something Different?

Not every business fits neatly into a tier. Some businesses need aggressive content production but minimal link building. Others need multi-location management without the full Domination scope. Some just need a one-time audit and roadmap.

**We build custom plans for businesses with specific needs.** Start with a [free audit](/free-seo-audit/) and we'll recommend the approach that makes the most sense for your market, your competition, and your goals.

## Pricing FAQ

### Why is there a 90-day minimum?

SEO is not a light switch. It takes time to audit your presence, implement optimizations, build authority, and let Google process the changes. Three months is the minimum timeframe needed to properly execute the [CATALYST methodology](/about/our-process/) and demonstrate measurable results. Agencies that promise results in 30 days are either lying or using tactics that will hurt you long-term. We'd rather set honest expectations and over-deliver.

### Can I upgrade or downgrade my plan?

Yes, anytime after the initial 90-day period. If your business is growing and you need more aggressive execution, upgrading is seamless — we simply expand scope the following month. If you need to scale back, you can downgrade with 30 days' notice. We'll adjust the strategy to maximize impact within your new budget.

### Are there any hidden fees?

None. No setup fees, no tool fees, no "content surcharges," no surprise invoices. If a project requires something outside normal scope — like a website redesign or a one-time large-scale citation cleanup — we'll discuss it with you beforehand and provide a clear quote. Nothing is ever charged without your approval.

### What's the difference between the free audit and the paid audit in the plans?

The [free SEO Visibility Scan](/free-seo-audit/) is a focused snapshot: GBP score, ranking overview, top competitors, quick wins, and technical health. It gives you enough data to understand where you stand. The CATALYST audit included in paid plans is a comprehensive deep dive: 200+ ranking factors, full backlink analysis, complete citation audit, detailed competitive mapping, and a prioritized strategic roadmap. Think of the free audit as an X-ray and the paid audit as a full-body MRI.
