Ranking in local search requires getting dozens of individual elements right simultaneously. Miss one critical factor — an incomplete Google Business Profile, inconsistent citations, a missing piece of schema markup — and your entire [local SEO strategy](/services/) underperforms. This checklist covers every element you need to address, organized by priority so you can focus on what moves the needle fastest.

Use this as a working document. Check off items as you complete them, and revisit quarterly to catch anything that has fallen out of alignment.

## Priority 1: Google Business Profile Optimization

Your Google Business Profile (GBP) is the single most influential ranking factor for the local pack. Get this right before spending significant time on anything else.

### Claiming and Verification

- [ ] Claim your Google Business Profile at business.google.com
- [ ] Complete the verification process (postcard, phone, email, or video depending on your business)
- [ ] If you have an existing listing, confirm you have owner-level access (not just manager access)
- [ ] Check for and request removal of any duplicate listings for your business

### Profile Completion

- [ ] Set your exact legal business name (no keyword stuffing — this violates Google's guidelines and risks suspension)
- [ ] Select the most accurate primary category for your business
- [ ] Add all relevant secondary categories (you can add up to 9)
- [ ] Enter your complete street address (or set your service area if you are a service-area business)
- [ ] Add your phone number (use a local number, not a toll-free number, as your primary)
- [ ] Set your website URL to your homepage or most relevant landing page
- [ ] Add your business hours, including special hours for holidays
- [ ] Write a complete business description using all 750 characters — include your primary services and service area naturally
- [ ] Add your opening date
- [ ] Add all applicable attributes (wheelchair accessible, women-led, veteran-led, etc.)

### Visual Content

- [ ] Upload a high-quality logo (minimum 250x250 pixels)
- [ ] Upload a cover photo that represents your business well
- [ ] Add at least 10 photos of your business interior, exterior, team, and work
- [ ] Add photos in each relevant category (interior, exterior, at work, team, products)
- [ ] Upload new photos at least monthly to keep your profile fresh
- [ ] Add video content if applicable (under 30 seconds, under 75MB)

### Ongoing GBP Management

- [ ] Publish Google Business Profile posts at least weekly (offers, updates, events)
- [ ] Respond to every customer review within 24-48 hours
- [ ] Answer all questions in the Q&A section promptly and accurately
- [ ] Pre-populate Q&A with common customer questions and detailed answers
- [ ] Add your products or services with descriptions and pricing
- [ ] Monitor your GBP Insights for performance trends monthly
- [ ] Check for and report any unauthorized edits to your listing

## Priority 2: On-Page SEO for Local Relevance

Your website must clearly communicate what you do, where you do it, and why you are the best choice. Every page should reinforce your local relevance.

### NAP Consistency

- [ ] Display your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) on every page (typically in the header or footer)
- [ ] Ensure your NAP matches your Google Business Profile exactly — character for character
- [ ] Make your phone number clickable (use tel: links for mobile users)
- [ ] Mark up your NAP with LocalBusiness schema (see Technical SEO section)

### Title Tags and Meta Descriptions

- [ ] Include your primary keyword and city in your homepage title tag
- [ ] Write unique title tags for every service page, including geographic modifiers where appropriate
- [ ] Keep title tags under 60 characters to avoid truncation
- [ ] Write compelling meta descriptions (under 160 characters) for every page with a clear value proposition
- [ ] Include your city or service area in meta descriptions where natural

### Content Optimization

- [ ] Create a dedicated page for each core service you offer
- [ ] Include your city and service area naturally in H1, H2, and body content
- [ ] Write at least 800-1,200 words of unique, valuable content on each service page
- [ ] Add locally relevant content — mention local landmarks, neighborhoods, service areas, or local regulations
- [ ] Include clear calls to action on every page (call, form submission, direction request)
- [ ] Avoid thin content — every page should offer genuine value to the reader

### Location Pages (Multi-Location or Service-Area Businesses)

- [ ] Create a unique page for each location or primary service area
- [ ] Write unique content for each location page (do not just swap city names)
- [ ] Include the specific address, phone number, and hours for each location
- [ ] Embed a Google Map for each location
- [ ] Add location-specific testimonials, team member profiles, or project examples
- [ ] Link location pages from your main navigation or a prominent locations hub

For detailed guidance on optimizing individual pages, see our [on-page SEO services](/services/on-page-optimization/).

## Priority 3: Technical SEO Foundations

Technical issues are silent killers. They do not announce themselves, but they undermine everything you build on top of them.

### Schema Markup

- [ ] Implement LocalBusiness (or the most specific applicable subtype) schema on your homepage
- [ ] Include all required properties: name, address, telephone, openingHours, geo coordinates
- [ ] Add schema for each location if you have multiple
- [ ] Implement Review/AggregateRating schema if you display reviews on your site
- [ ] Add FAQ schema to pages with FAQ sections (including this page if published on your site)
- [ ] Validate all schema using Google's Rich Results Test tool

### Mobile and Page Speed

- [ ] Ensure your site is fully mobile-responsive (test on actual devices, not just browser resize)
- [ ] Achieve a Core Web Vitals "Good" rating for all three metrics (LCP, INP, CLS)
- [ ] Target page load times under 3 seconds on mobile connections
- [ ] Compress images and serve them in next-gen formats (WebP or AVIF)
- [ ] Eliminate render-blocking resources in the critical path
- [ ] Enable browser caching and GZIP/Brotli compression

### Crawlability and Indexing

- [ ] Submit your XML sitemap to Google Search Console
- [ ] Ensure no critical pages are blocked by robots.txt
- [ ] Fix all 404 errors and broken internal links
- [ ] Implement proper 301 redirects for any changed URLs
- [ ] Ensure your site uses HTTPS throughout (no mixed content warnings)
- [ ] Set up and monitor Google Search Console for crawl errors and indexing issues

## Priority 4: Citation Building and Management

Citations reinforce your business's existence, legitimacy, and location across the web. Consistency is critical.

### Foundation Citations

- [ ] Submit to the four major data aggregators (Data Axle, Neustar Localeze, Foursquare, Yelp)

- [ ] Ensure NAP information is identical across every citation (exact match to your GBP)
- [ ] Include your website URL and business categories in every directory listing

### Industry and Local Citations

- [ ] Submit to all relevant industry-specific directories (e.g., Avvo for attorneys, Healthgrades for doctors, HomeAdvisor for contractors)

- [ ] Update all citations immediately if your business name, address, phone number, or website URL changes
- [ ] Monitor for unauthorized changes or new duplicate listings

## Priority 5: Review Generation and Management

Reviews influence rankings, click-through rates, and conversion rates. A consistent review generation system is essential.

### Review Generation

- [ ] Create a direct review link for your Google Business Profile (use the Place ID method for a short, clean URL)
- [ ] Implement a systematic process for requesting reviews from satisfied customers
- [ ] Send review requests within 24 hours of service completion while the experience is fresh
- [ ] Use email and/or SMS for review requests (with proper consent for SMS)
- [ ] Train front-line staff on how and when to verbally request reviews
- [ ] Set a target of at least 5-10 new Google reviews per month (adjust based on your industry average)
- [ ] Diversify review platforms — encourage reviews on Yelp, Facebook, and industry-specific platforms

### Review Management

- [ ] Respond to every positive review with a personalized thank-you
- [ ] Respond to every negative review professionally and constructively within 24 hours
- [ ] Never offer incentives for reviews (this violates Google's policies)
- [ ] Flag and report clearly fake or spam reviews through Google's review reporting tool
- [ ] Monitor review velocity — sudden drops may indicate a process breakdown

## Priority 6: Link Building for Local Authority

Backlinks remain one of the most powerful ranking signals. Local links carry special weight for local search rankings.

### Local Link Opportunities

### Industry Link Opportunities

- [ ] Build relationships with local bloggers and influencers in your industry

## Priority 7: Content Strategy for Local Relevance

Ongoing content creation builds topical authority, attracts local backlinks, and gives you more pages to rank for local queries.

### Content Planning

- [ ] Research and document the top 50 questions your target customers ask
- [ ] Create a content calendar with at least 2-4 posts per month
- [ ] Map content topics to your service pages for internal linking support
- [ ] Include locally relevant topics (local regulations, community events, area-specific advice)
- [ ] Target long-tail local keywords that your service pages cannot rank for alone

### Content Execution

- [ ] Write comprehensive, genuinely helpful content (not thin articles published purely for SEO)
- [ ] Include internal links to your service pages and location pages in every post
- [ ] Optimize each post with proper title tags, meta descriptions, headers, and image alt text
- [ ] Add FAQ sections with schema markup where relevant
- [ ] Promote new content through your Google Business Profile posts and social channels

## Quarterly Audit Checkpoints

Even after completing every item above, local SEO requires ongoing maintenance. Set quarterly calendar reminders to:

- [ ] Re-audit all citations for accuracy
- [ ] Review and update Google Business Profile information, photos, and posts
- [ ] Analyze Google Search Console for new crawl errors or indexing issues
- [ ] Review Core Web Vitals scores and address any regressions
- [ ] Assess review velocity and adjust your generation process if needed
- [ ] Evaluate ranking progress and adjust strategy based on competitive changes
- [ ] Update content that has become outdated or has dropped in rankings

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How many of these items do I need to complete before seeing results?**
You do not need to complete every item to start seeing improvement. Completing Priority 1 (Google Business Profile) and Priority 2 (on-page SEO) alone will produce measurable gains for most businesses within 60-90 days. Each additional priority layer compounds the results. The full checklist represents a complete local SEO strategy, but the priorities are designed so you can implement in stages.

**Should I complete this checklist myself or hire a professional?**
That depends on your available time, technical comfort level, and competitive landscape. Priorities 1, 4, and 5 are largely manageable for non-technical business owners. Priorities 2, 3, and 6 typically require SEO experience or technical knowledge. If you are in a competitive market, professional execution across all priorities will produce faster and stronger results.

**How often should I revisit this checklist?**
Review the full checklist quarterly. Some elements are one-time tasks (schema implementation, initial citation building), while others require ongoing effort (review generation, content creation, GBP posting). The quarterly audit checkpoints at the end of this list cover the most critical recurring tasks.

**What is the most commonly missed item on this checklist?**
Citation consistency. Most businesses have inaccurate or outdated citations they do not know about — old phone numbers from a previous phone system, former addresses, misspelled business names. These inconsistencies actively confuse Google and suppress your local rankings. A thorough citation audit frequently uncovers dozens of issues that, once fixed, produce noticeable ranking improvements.

## Start With a Baseline Audit
