## Two Types of Citations, One Complete Strategy

Not every citation looks the same. Some are formal directory listings with your business name, address, and phone number neatly organized in dedicated fields. Others are mentions of your business scattered across blog posts, news articles, social media, and community forums — no structured fields, just your information appearing naturally in flowing text.

Both types matter. They serve different functions in Google's local ranking algorithm, they require different building strategies, and most local businesses only invest in one while ignoring the other entirely.

At LocalCatalyst, our [citation building services](/services/citation-building/) encompass both structured and unstructured citations because a complete citation profile requires both. Understanding the distinction — and knowing how to build each type strategically — is what separates businesses that dominate local search from those that merely participate in it.

**[Order Your SEO Audit](/services/seo-audit/)** — We'll analyze your citation profile across both types and show you where the gaps are.

## What Are Structured Citations?

Structured citations are formal business listings on directories and platforms that store your information in specific, organized fields. Your business name goes in a name field. Your address goes in an address field. Your phone number goes in a phone field. The data is structured, consistent, and machine-readable.

### Examples of Structured Citations

- **Google Business Profile** — The most important structured citation for any local business
- **Yelp** — Business listing with NAP, categories, hours, photos, and reviews
- **Bing Places** — Microsoft's equivalent of Google Business Profile
- **Apple Maps / Apple Business Connect** — Apple's business listing platform
- **Facebook Business Page** — Social platform with structured business information
- **Better Business Bureau (BBB)** — Accredited business listings
- **Industry directories** — Healthgrades, Avvo, HomeAdvisor, and other [niche citation](/services/citation-building/niche-citations/) platforms
- **Data aggregators** — Data Axle, Foursquare, Localeze/Neustar, Factual — the upstream data sources that feed information to downstream directories

### Characteristics of Structured Citations

- **Consistent format** — NAP data is stored in dedicated fields, making it easy for search engines to parse
- **Self-submitted** — You (or your agency) create and manage these listings directly
- **Controllable** — You can update information when your business details change
- **Auditable** — Easy to find, verify, and correct through [citation cleanup](/services/citation-building/citation-cleanup/)
- **Scalable** — Can be built systematically across dozens of platforms

### Why Structured Citations Matter

Structured citations are the foundation of local SEO citation signals. They're what Google cross-references to verify your business information. When your Google Business Profile says you're at 123 Main Street and 50+ directories confirm that address in their structured data fields, Google has high confidence that your business is actually located at 123 Main Street.

**NAP consistency across structured citations is one of the top 5 local ranking factors.** This is why [citation cleanup](/services/citation-building/citation-cleanup/) — fixing inconsistencies across your structured citation profile — produces measurable ranking improvements.

## What Are Unstructured Citations?

Unstructured citations are mentions of your business information on websites where your NAP data appears within regular content rather than in dedicated listing fields. Your business name, address, or phone number shows up naturally in paragraphs, articles, event listings, or social posts — without the formal structure of a directory listing.

### Examples of Unstructured Citations

- **Local news articles** — "Smith Plumbing, located at 123 Main Street, donated $5,000 to the community center renovation project."
- **Blog post mentions** — "We hired Smith Plumbing (512-555-1234) for our kitchen remodel and the experience was excellent."
- **Event listings** — "This year's Community Health Fair is sponsored by Downtown Dental, 456 Oak Avenue."
- **Social media mentions** — A customer tagging your business with your address in a Facebook post
- **Forum discussions** — A Reddit thread recommending your business with your phone number or address included
- **Press releases** — Media releases mentioning your business information within the body text
- **Chamber of commerce articles** — Feature stories about members that include business details within the narrative
- **Podcast show notes** — Episode descriptions that mention your business and contact information

### Characteristics of Unstructured Citations

- **Organic format** — Your information appears naturally within text, not in structured data fields
- **Often third-party generated** — Other people, publications, and organizations create these mentions without your direct submission
- **Harder to control** — You can influence but not directly manage how others mention your business
- **Harder to audit** — No structured fields to scan; requires content-level analysis to find
- **Higher trust signal per citation** — Because unstructured citations are typically editorial or organic, they carry stronger authenticity signals

### Why Unstructured Citations Matter

Unstructured citations matter precisely because they're harder to manufacture. A structured directory listing can be created by anyone with 10 minutes and an internet connection. An unstructured mention in a local newspaper article exists because a journalist decided your business was worth writing about.

Google's algorithms distinguish between self-submitted signals (structured citations) and third-party endorsements (unstructured citations). Both matter, but unstructured citations carry a dimension of trust that structured citations alone cannot provide. They represent genuine external validation — the digital equivalent of word-of-mouth.

Unstructured citations also support your [link building efforts](/managed/). Many unstructured citations include links back to your website, making them a hybrid signal that provides both citation value and backlink authority. A local newspaper article that mentions your business name, address, and phone number while also linking to your site delivers triple value: citation signal, backlink authority, and referral traffic.

## How Google Uses Each Type Differently

Understanding Google's approach to each citation type explains why you need both:

### Structured Citations: Verification and Consistency

Google uses structured citations primarily for **data verification**. When your Google Business Profile lists your address, Google checks structured citations across the web to confirm that address. The more consistent your structured citations, the more confident Google is in your business data. This confidence directly influences Map Pack rankings and local organic visibility.

**The signal:** "Multiple trusted directories confirm this business information is accurate."

### Unstructured Citations: Authority and Prominence

Google uses unstructured citations as signals of **business prominence and community standing**. A business that gets mentioned in local news articles, industry publications, and community discussions is more prominent than a business that exists only in directory listings.

**The signal:** "This business is recognized and referenced by third-party sources in its community and industry."

### The Combined Effect

Businesses with strong profiles across both types rank higher than businesses strong in only one. Structured citations provide the data consistency foundation. Unstructured citations provide the authority and prominence layer. Together, they create a complete trust profile that satisfies Google's local ranking algorithm.

This is the same principle behind our integrated approach to [local SEO](/services/): no single signal dominates. It's the combination of consistent citations, strong [GBP optimization](/services/gbp-optimization/), quality backlinks, and positive reputation signals that produces rankings.

## Building Strategies for Each Type

### Building Structured Citations

Structured citation building is systematic and controllable:

1. **Audit existing citations** for consistency ([citation cleanup](/services/citation-building/citation-cleanup/) first)
2. **Submit to core platforms** — Google, Yelp, Bing, Apple, Facebook, BBB
3. **Submit to industry directories** — [Niche citations](/services/citation-building/niche-citations/) relevant to your vertical
4. **Submit to data aggregators** — Data Axle, Foursquare, Localeze, Factual (ensures downstream propagation)
5. **Submit to local directories** — Regional and city-level directories in your service area
6. **Monitor and maintain** — Ongoing consistency monitoring and correction

**Timeline:** A comprehensive structured citation build takes 30-60 days for initial submissions, with full propagation and verification at 60-90 days.

### Building Unstructured Citations

Unstructured citation building requires different strategies because you're influencing mentions rather than submitting listings:

- **Local media coverage** — [Digital PR](/managed/digital-pr/) campaigns that earn news coverage mentioning your business
- **Community involvement** — Sponsorships, charity events, and partnerships that generate community mentions
- **Guest content** — [Guest posting](/managed/guest-posting/) on local and industry publications that mention your business naturally
- **Social media engagement** — Active participation in local community discussions and groups
- **Customer encouragement** — Encouraging happy customers to share their experience (with your business details) on blogs, forums, and social platforms
- **Event participation** — Hosting or participating in events that generate coverage and social mentions

**Timeline:** Unstructured citations build gradually over months. Unlike structured citations, there's no "submit and wait" process — it's ongoing relationship building and community engagement that generates mentions organically.

## Which to Prioritize and When

### Prioritize Structured Citations First If:

- You're a new business or haven't invested in citations before
- Your existing citations have significant inconsistencies (cleanup needed)
- You're missing from major directories and industry platforms
- Your competitors have significantly more structured citations

### Prioritize Unstructured Citations If:

- Your structured citation foundation is solid (90%+ consistency)
- You've hit a ranking plateau despite strong on-page and citation work
- Your competitors are getting media coverage and community mentions that you aren't
- You're in a competitive market where structured citations alone don't differentiate you

### Build Both Simultaneously If:

- You're in a highly competitive local market
- You have the budget for comprehensive citation building and [digital PR](/managed/digital-pr/) or [local link building](/managed/local-link-building/)
- Your competitors have strong profiles in both categories
- You're pursuing an aggressive growth timeline

For most of our clients, we start with structured citation cleanup and building (months 1-3), then layer in unstructured citation strategies (months 3+) as the foundation stabilizes. This phased approach is built into our [CATALYST methodology](/services/).

## How Unstructured Citations Support Link Building

Unstructured citations and link building overlap significantly. Here's how:

- **News coverage** that mentions your business often includes a link — earning both an unstructured citation and a backlink from a high-authority domain
- **Blog mentions** from local bloggers and industry writers frequently link to your site alongside the business mention
- **Community organization mentions** (chamber of commerce features, nonprofit partnership stories) typically include links to sponsor and partner websites
- **Event coverage** mentions sponsors and participants with links to their sites

This overlap means that [digital PR](/managed/digital-pr/) and [local link building](/managed/local-link-building/) campaigns naturally produce unstructured citations as a secondary benefit. At LocalCatalyst, we track both the link value and the citation value of every media placement and community mention.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can Google actually tell the difference between structured and unstructured citations?

Yes. Google's algorithms are sophisticated enough to identify business information in both structured data fields and natural language text. They parse structured listings directly from database fields and use natural language processing (NLP) to extract business mentions from unstructured content. Both feed into Google's knowledge graph and local ranking calculations.

### Are unstructured citations harder to build than structured ones?

Yes. Structured citations can be built systematically — you submit listings to directories and the work is done. Unstructured citations require earning mentions from third parties through media coverage, community involvement, customer advocacy, and content placement. They take more time and effort, but they carry higher trust value per citation because of that difficulty.

### Do I need to worry about NAP consistency in unstructured citations?

To a lesser degree than with structured citations, but yes. If a news article mentions your business with an old phone number or wrong address, it's not as damaging as a directory listing with incorrect data — but it does introduce noise into Google's data reconciliation process. When we earn unstructured citations through PR and outreach, we ensure the correct business information is included in every pitch and press material.

### How do you track unstructured citations?

We use brand mention monitoring tools, backlink analysis tools, and manual review to identify unstructured citations across the web. We track the source, the business information included, whether a link is present, and the domain authority of the citing source. Unstructured citations are reported alongside structured citations in your monthly citation health report.

### Which type of citation matters more for Map Pack rankings?

Structured citation consistency is the more direct Map Pack ranking factor — Google uses it for data verification, which directly influences whether your business appears in the Map Pack at all. Unstructured citations contribute to the "prominence" component of local ranking, which determines your position within the Map Pack. For maximum Map Pack performance, you need both: consistent structured citations for eligibility and strong unstructured mentions for prominence.

## A Complete Citation Strategy Needs Both

Structured citations are the foundation. Unstructured citations are the differentiator. Together, they build the complete trust profile that Google's local ranking algorithm rewards with visibility, rankings, and customers.
