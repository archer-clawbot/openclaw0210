Choosing an SEO company is a decision that will affect your business for months or years. The wrong choice means wasted money and lost time. The right choice means compounding growth that pays for itself many times over.

The problem is that most business owners do not know what to ask during the evaluation process, and many SEO agencies are skilled at giving impressive-sounding answers that lack substance. This guide provides the specific questions you should ask, organized by category, along with what good answers sound like and what responses should concern you.

## Strategy and Approach Questions

### 1. What is your process for developing an SEO strategy for a new client?

**Good answer:** A description of a structured process that begins with a thorough audit, includes competitive research, defines specific goals and KPIs, and results in a documented strategy. The agency should explain that strategy is customized based on your business, not templated.

**Red flag answer:** Vague language like "we use our proven formula" or "we optimize your site and build links" without specifics. If the process sounds identical regardless of client type, the work probably is too.

### 2. How do you determine which keywords to target?

**Good answer:** The agency should discuss search volume, ranking difficulty, search intent, business relevance, and competitive landscape. They should emphasize targeting terms that drive revenue, not just traffic. For local businesses, they should mention geographic modifiers, service-specific terms, and near-me search patterns.

**Red flag answer:** "We target the keywords with the highest search volume" or "We go after whatever terms you tell us." Both indicate a lack of strategic thinking. High-volume terms are often unrealistic targets, and clients should not be expected to define keyword strategy.

### 3. How do you approach link building?

**Good answer:** A description of manual outreach methods: guest posting on relevant sites, local partnerships, resource page link building, digital PR, or content-driven link acquisition. The agency should be willing to share examples of links they have built for other clients.

**Red flag answer:** "We have a network of sites we place links on" or unwillingness to explain their methods. This often indicates private blog networks (PBNs) or paid link schemes that violate Google's guidelines and carry penalty risk.

### 4. How do you stay current with Google algorithm updates?

**Good answer:** References to specific industry resources, testing methodologies, and a track record of adapting strategies in response to major updates. The agency should acknowledge that algorithm updates sometimes require strategic pivots and should describe how they have handled past updates.

**Red flag answer:** "Our strategies are algorithm-proof" or dismissive attitudes toward updates. No strategy is algorithm-proof. Agencies that claim otherwise either do not understand SEO deeply enough or are being dishonest.

### 5. What does your content creation process look like?

**Good answer:** A described workflow that includes topic research, keyword targeting, outline creation, writing by experienced writers with subject matter review, SEO optimization, and publication. For specialized industries, they should ask how they handle accuracy and expertise requirements.

**Red flag answer:** "We use AI to generate content at scale" without discussing human review, fact-checking, or quality control. AI-assisted content can be effective, but fully automated content without expert oversight produces generic material that does not build authority.

## Reporting and Measurement Questions

### 6. What metrics do you track, and how do you report on them?

**Good answer:** Rankings for target keywords, organic traffic, conversions (calls, forms, etc.), Google Business Profile metrics, link acquisition, and technical health indicators. The agency should emphasize business outcomes, not just rankings.

**Red flag answer:** "We track rankings" with no mention of conversions or business metrics. Rankings without revenue correlation are vanity metrics.

### 7. Can I see a sample report?

**Good answer:** Willingness to provide a sample (with client names removed). A good report includes clear data visualization, context for the numbers, connection between activities and results, and forward-looking recommendations.

**Red flag answer:** Refusal to share a sample or providing a report that is just a data dump without analysis or context.

### 8. How often will we meet or communicate?

**Good answer:** Monthly strategy calls at minimum, with additional touchpoints for urgent matters. Many agencies offer bi-weekly calls during the first 3-6 months. Clear response time expectations for emails and questions (typically 1 business day).

**Red flag answer:** "We send a monthly report and you can email us if you have questions." Reactive-only communication usually means the agency is spread too thin or does not invest in client relationships.

### 9. Will I have access to my own data and analytics?

**Good answer:** Unequivocal yes. You should maintain access to Google Analytics, Google Search Console, and any rank tracking tools. The agency should set up tracking using your accounts, not theirs.

**Red flag answer:** "We handle all the analytics on our end" or any resistance to sharing access. Agencies that control your data create dependency and make it difficult to evaluate their work or transition to another provider.

## Results and Track Record Questions

### 10. Can you share case studies or results from businesses similar to mine?

**Good answer:** Specific case studies with metrics: starting rankings, ending rankings, traffic growth percentages, lead increases, and revenue impact. Industry and location relevance adds credibility. References from current or past clients offer even more value.

**Red flag answer:** Generic claims like "we've helped hundreds of businesses grow" without specific data. If an agency cannot demonstrate results with real metrics, they may not be producing them.

### 11. What results can I realistically expect in 6 and 12 months?

**Good answer:** Honest projections that acknowledge uncertainty. A good agency will frame expectations around typical outcomes for similar businesses while noting that specific results depend on competition, starting position, and market factors. Expect language like "businesses in your situation typically see X% growth in 6 months."

**Red flag answer:** Guarantees of specific rankings or traffic numbers. No one can guarantee SEO outcomes because no one controls Google's algorithm. Our guide on [SEO red flags](/blog/seo-red-flags/) covers this in detail.

### 12. What happens if results are not meeting expectations?

**Good answer:** A described process for evaluating underperformance, adjusting strategy, and communicating transparently about challenges. The agency should acknowledge that not every campaign performs identically and should explain how they diagnose and respond to stalled progress.

**Red flag answer:** "That doesn't happen with our clients" or avoidance of the question. Every agency has campaigns that underperform expectations at some point. The question is how they handle it.

## Contract and Business Questions

### 13. What is your minimum contract length, and why?

**Good answer:** Typically 6-12 months with a clear explanation that SEO takes time to produce results. The agency should be transparent about why minimum commitments exist (investment in setup, time for strategies to compound) rather than treating it as a given.

**Red flag answer:** 24-month or longer minimums with steep early termination fees. While short commitments are impractical for SEO, excessively long contracts often indicate an agency that relies on lock-in rather than results to retain clients.

### 14. What happens to my content and optimizations if I cancel?

**Good answer:** Everything stays. Content on your site, technical optimizations, citation profiles, and all data remain yours. The agency should confirm this explicitly and include it in the contract.

**Red flag answer:** Hesitation, or references to proprietary content or assets that the agency retains ownership of. If the agency built content on your domain, it should belong to you.

### 15. Who specifically will work on my account?

**Good answer:** Names and roles of the team members who will be doing the actual work, along with their experience levels. A senior strategist should be involved even if junior team members handle execution.

**Red flag answer:** "Our team of experts" without naming individuals. This often means your account will be handed off to whoever is available, with no consistent point of contact.

### 16. How many clients does my account manager handle?

**Good answer:** A specific number, typically 8-15 depending on the agency's model and the scope of each account. This tells you how much attention your business will receive.

**Red flag answer:** Refusal to answer or numbers above 30. Account managers handling too many clients cannot provide meaningful strategic attention to any of them.

## Technical and Tactical Questions

### 17. How do you handle technical SEO issues?

**Good answer:** A described process for regular technical audits (quarterly at minimum), prioritization of issues by impact, and either in-house development resources or a process for coordinating with your web developer. The agency should mention specific tools they use for technical analysis.

**Red flag answer:** "We focus on content and links, not technical stuff." Technical SEO is foundational. Ignoring it is like building a house on a cracked foundation.

### 18. Do you follow Google's Webmaster Guidelines?

**Good answer:** An unequivocal yes, with specifics about what that means: no link schemes, no cloaking, no keyword stuffing, no hidden text, and no manipulative tactics. The agency should be proactive about this topic, not defensive.

**Red flag answer:** "We use aggressive strategies" or "sometimes you need to push boundaries." Translation: they use tactics that risk Google penalties. The short-term gains are not worth the long-term damage.

### 19. How do you handle a Google algorithm update that negatively affects my rankings?

**Good answer:** A described process for diagnosing the impact, identifying which update caused the change, analyzing what the update targeted, and adjusting strategy accordingly. The agency should have experience navigating past updates (Helpful Content, Core Updates, etc.) and be able to describe specific responses they implemented.

**Red flag answer:** "Our white-hat approach means updates don't affect our clients." This is factually incorrect. Algorithm updates can affect any site, even those following best practices. The difference is in how quickly and effectively the agency responds.

### 20. What tools and platforms do you use?

**Good answer:** A list of professional tools with explanations of how each is used: Ahrefs or SEMrush for research and tracking, Screaming Frog for technical auditing, Google Search Console and Analytics for performance data, BrightLocal or similar for local SEO monitoring. The agency should be transparent about their tool stack.

**Red flag answer:** Unwillingness to share their tools or reliance solely on free tools. Professional SEO requires professional tools, and an agency's tool investment reflects their commitment to delivering quality work.

## How to Use These Questions

Do not treat this list as a checklist to run through mechanically in a single meeting. Instead, weave these questions naturally into your conversations during the evaluation process.

Pay attention not just to what agencies say but how they say it. Confident, specific, transparent answers indicate an agency that knows its craft and operates honestly. Vague, defensive, or overly salesy responses are data points that should factor into your decision.

Also evaluate how the agency asks questions of you. A good agency should be deeply curious about your business: your customers, your competitive landscape, your goals, and your past marketing efforts. If the conversation is entirely one-directional, with them selling and you listening, the relationship will likely follow the same pattern.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many SEO companies should I evaluate before making a decision?

Three to five is a productive range. Fewer than three does not give you enough comparison data. More than five introduces decision fatigue without proportional benefit. Focus on agencies that specialize in your business size and type rather than casting the widest possible net.

### Should I ask for a free audit before signing a contract?

A preliminary audit is a reasonable request and a good way to evaluate an agency's analytical capabilities. However, recognize that a free audit will be limited in scope compared to the comprehensive audit that begins a paid engagement. Use it as an indicator of the agency's thoroughness and communication style.

### Is it a bad sign if an agency asks about my budget?

No. Budget discussions are a normal part of the evaluation process. An agency needs to understand your investment level to determine whether they can deliver meaningful results within that range. An agency that quotes without asking about budget, goals, or competitive landscape is likely providing a one-size-fits-all proposal.

### What if an agency cannot answer all of these questions satisfactorily?

No agency will provide perfect answers to every question. What matters is the overall pattern. An agency that answers 15 of 20 questions with confidence, specificity, and transparency is a strong candidate. An agency that struggles with more than half should be eliminated from consideration.
