The Products and Services sections of your Google Business Profile are among the most underutilized features available to local businesses. While most owners focus on categories, reviews, and photos, the products and services sections provide direct signals to Google about what you offer, and they give potential customers detailed information right on your listing.

Setting these sections up correctly improves search matching, increases the relevance of your listing for specific queries, and helps customers self-qualify before they ever contact you. This is a foundational element of thorough [Google Business Profile management](/google-business-profile-management/).

## Understanding the Difference: Products vs. Services

Google treats products and services as separate sections with different formats and capabilities. Understanding the distinction helps you use each one correctly.

### The Services Section

The Services section is structured as a categorized list of services with descriptions. It is available to most business categories and is ideal for service-based businesses (plumbers, lawyers, dentists, consultants, agencies).

Services are organized into custom categories that you define, with individual services listed under each category. Each service can include a name, description (up to 300 characters), and optionally a price or price range.

### The Products Section

The Products section functions more like a mini storefront. It supports images, detailed descriptions, pricing, and direct links to product pages on your website. It is available to businesses that sell tangible goods, though many service businesses use it creatively to showcase service packages.

Products are organized into collections and are more visually prominent on your listing than services, as each product displays with an image.

## Setting Up Services: Step by Step

### Step 1: Define Your Service Categories

Before entering anything into the GBP dashboard, outline your service categories on paper. Group related services together in a way that makes sense to customers.

For example, a dental practice might organize services into:
- General Dentistry (cleanings, exams, fillings, extractions)
- Cosmetic Dentistry (veneers, whitening, bonding)
- Restorative Dentistry (crowns, bridges, implants)
- Emergency Services (same-day appointments, pain management)

A home services company might use:
- Plumbing Repair (leak repair, pipe replacement, drain clearing)
- Water Heater Services (installation, repair, tankless conversion)
- Bathroom Remodeling (full remodel, fixture installation, tiling)

### Step 2: Write Service Descriptions

You have 300 characters per service description. Use them strategically.

**Include in each description:**
- What the service involves
- Who it is for or when it is needed
- A differentiating detail about how you deliver it

**Example descriptions:**

*Leak Detection and Repair:* "Advanced leak detection using acoustic and thermal imaging technology. We locate and repair hidden leaks in walls, slabs, and underground pipes with minimal disruption to your property."

*Teeth Whitening:* "Professional in-office whitening treatment that lightens teeth up to 8 shades in a single visit. Custom trays provided for touch-ups at home. Safe for sensitive teeth."

**Avoid:**
- Generic descriptions that could apply to any business
- Keyword stuffing or unnatural phrasing
- Promotional language ("best in town," "cheapest prices")
- Leaving descriptions blank

### Step 3: Add Pricing Strategically

Pricing is optional for services, and whether to include it depends on your business model and industry.

**Add pricing when:**
- Your services have standardized pricing (e.g., "$99 drain cleaning")
- Price transparency is a competitive advantage in your market
- Customers frequently ask about pricing before booking

**Use price ranges when:**
- Service costs vary based on scope ("$200 - $500")
- You want to set expectations without committing to a fixed price
- Your industry norm is to provide estimates rather than fixed rates

**Omit pricing when:**
- Every job requires a custom quote
- Displaying prices could deter qualified leads (common in high-end services)
- Your pricing changes frequently

### Step 4: Map Services to Categories

Ensure your services section reinforces your category selections. If "Emergency Plumber" is one of your [GBP categories](/blog/google-business-profile-categories/), your services section should include emergency plumbing services with appropriate descriptions.

This alignment strengthens the relevance signal. When Google sees that your categories, services, and business description all consistently reference the same service areas, it increases confidence in your listing's relevance for those queries.

## Setting Up Products: Step by Step

### Step 1: Create Collections

Collections are the organizational structure for products. Create logical groupings that help customers browse.

Keep collection names clear and descriptive:
- "Residential HVAC Systems" rather than "Our Products"
- "Wedding Photography Packages" rather than "Packages"
- "Organic Skincare" rather than "Products"

### Step 2: Add Products with Images

Every product should have a high-quality image. This is non-negotiable. Products without images are significantly less engaging and receive fewer clicks.

**Image requirements:**
- Minimum 720px wide
- Well-lit, professional quality
- Show the actual product or service result (not stock photos)
- Square or landscape orientation works best

### Step 3: Write Product Descriptions

Product descriptions can be longer than service descriptions, giving you more room to detail features, benefits, and specifications.

**Effective product descriptions include:**
- What the product or package includes
- Key features or specifications
- Who the product is best suited for
- Any warranties, guarantees, or terms

### Step 4: Set Pricing and Links

**Pricing:** Display accurate, current pricing for all products. If you offer seasonal sales or promotions, update pricing accordingly.

**Product links:** Each product can link to a specific page on your website. Use this feature to drive traffic to your highest-converting product pages. Ensure the linked page contains the same product information and pricing shown on your GBP listing for consistency.

## Impact on Search Matching

Products and services affect search matching in several important ways.

**Query relevance.** When a user searches for a specific service, Google can match that query against the services listed on your profile. A listing that explicitly includes "tankless water heater installation" as a service has stronger relevance for that search than one that only lists the broad category "Plumber."

**Long-tail visibility.** Detailed service and product descriptions help your listing appear for specific, long-tail queries. Instead of only matching broad terms, you can capture searches like "same-day emergency tooth extraction" or "whole-house water filtration installation."

**Customer pre-qualification.** When customers can see exactly what you offer and at what price point before contacting you, the leads you receive are more qualified. This reduces time spent on inquiries that are not a good fit.

**Rich listing display.** Products and services can appear as additional content on your listing, making it more visually substantial and informative than competitor listings that lack this content.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Leaving sections empty.** An empty services or products section is a missed opportunity. Even a basic setup is better than nothing.

**Duplicate entries.** Do not list the same service under multiple categories or create near-identical products. Keep each entry unique.

**Outdated information.** If you discontinue a service or change pricing, update your GBP listing. Outdated information erodes trust and can lead to negative reviews when customer expectations do not match reality.

**Ignoring the section entirely.** Many businesses set up their categories and description and skip products and services altogether. This leaves a significant optimization gap. Review your complete setup against our [GBP optimization checklist](/blog/google-business-profile-checklist/).

**Using the wrong section.** Service businesses should primarily use the Services section. The Products section works for tangible goods or packaged service offerings. Using both is appropriate when your business offers a mix.

## Maintaining Your Products and Services

Products and services are not set-and-forget sections. Build maintenance into your regular [GBP management](/google-business-profile-management/) routine.

**Monthly:** Review descriptions for accuracy. Update pricing if needed. Add any new services or products you have launched.

**Quarterly:** Audit the full list. Remove discontinued offerings. Refresh descriptions based on search query data from your [GBP analytics](/blog/gbp-insights-analytics/). Check if new category-specific options have become available.

**Annually:** Complete overhaul. Rewrite descriptions to reflect current messaging and positioning. Reorganize categories if your service mix has evolved. Update all images.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do products and services directly affect GBP rankings?

Products and services provide additional relevance signals that can influence which searches your listing appears for. They are not as heavily weighted as primary categories or reviews, but they contribute to the overall completeness and relevance of your profile. Businesses with fully populated products and services sections consistently receive more search impressions for specific service-related queries.

### How many services should I list on my Google Business Profile?

List every distinct service you offer, organized into logical categories. There is no penalty for having a comprehensive services list as long as every entry represents a real service you provide. Most service businesses benefit from listing 15-30 individual services across 3-6 categories.

### Can I use the Products section if I am a service-based business?

Yes. Many service businesses use the Products section to showcase service packages, bundled offerings, or flagship services that benefit from visual presentation. For example, a wedding photographer might list different photography packages as "products" with sample images and pricing.

### Why are my products or services not showing up on my listing?

New products and services can take 24-72 hours to appear. If they still do not show after that period, check that your business category supports these features (some categories have limited access), ensure your listing is verified and in good standing, and confirm that your entries meet Google's content guidelines.
