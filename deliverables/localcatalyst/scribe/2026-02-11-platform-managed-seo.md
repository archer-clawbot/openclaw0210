# Fully Managed SEO -- We Handle Everything

**You run the business. We run the SEO. Every part of it.**

Some businesses want to buy individual deliverables and execute their own strategy. That is what our [a la carte products](/services/) are for.

But if you want someone to own the entire SEO function -- strategy, execution, tracking, reporting, and ongoing optimization -- this is what managed SEO is built for. One monthly fee. One team. Every lever pulled on your behalf.

## What Managed SEO Includes

Managed SEO is not a package. It is a partnership. We scope the engagement based on your market, competition, locations, and goals -- then we build and execute a custom strategy using the full CATALYST system.

Here is what that covers:

### Strategy and Roadmap
A complete SEO strategy built on audit data, competitive analysis, and keyword research. Updated quarterly as the market shifts. You always know what we are doing and why.

### Technical SEO
Full technical audit and ongoing remediation. Site speed, Core Web Vitals, crawlability, indexation, schema markup, mobile optimization -- everything that affects how Google reads and ranks your site. We monitor continuously and fix issues before they cost you rankings.

### Content Production
Blog posts, service pages, location pages, and landing pages -- produced on a schedule that builds topical authority month over month. Every piece is keyword-targeted, internally linked, and aligned to your [topical map](/services/topical-map/).

### Google Business Profile Management
Complete GBP optimization and ongoing management using our 5-SPEC framework. Weekly posts, photo strategy, Q&A management, category optimization, service listings, and review monitoring. Your profile stays active, accurate, and competitive.

### Citation Building and Cleanup
Initial citation build across 50+ directories, followed by ongoing monitoring for accuracy. NAP consistency is maintained, duplicates are resolved, and new citation opportunities are pursued as they emerge.

### Link Acquisition
Targeted local link building through digital PR, resource page outreach, local partnerships, community sponsorships, and industry-relevant directories. Quality over quantity, every month.

### Review Strategy
Systems and processes to generate authentic customer reviews on Google and industry-specific platforms. Review monitoring, response templates, and negative review management included.

### Competitor Monitoring
We track your top competitors' rankings, content, backlinks, GBP activity, and review velocity. When they make a move, we know about it -- and we respond before it affects your position.

### Geo-Grid Tracking
Visual ranking maps showing exactly where you rank for target keywords across every point in your service area. Not just one location -- your entire coverage zone, tracked monthly.

### Algorithm Update Response
When Google rolls out an update, you don't panic. We analyze the impact, identify what changed, and adjust strategy immediately. Our managed clients are insulated from the disruption that algorithm updates cause for unmanaged sites.

### Monthly Reporting
Clear, actionable reports connecting SEO activity to business outcomes. Rankings, traffic, calls, form submissions, GBP actions, and revenue attribution where possible. Every report includes your Share of Local Voice (SoLV) — your percentage of total local search visibility — and Weighted Visibility Score (WVS), a composite metric that weights rankings by search volume and commercial intent. No vanity metrics. No 40-page PDFs full of charts you won't read.

### Dedicated Account Management
A real person who knows your business, your market, and your goals. Monthly or bi-weekly strategy calls. Direct access when you need it. Not a ticket queue.

## Already Buying A La Carte?

If you are already purchasing individual deliverables from our platform -- audits, content pages, topical maps, schema markup -- managed SEO is the natural next step.

For a flat monthly fee, we handle everything you have been buying, plus the strategy and reporting you cannot get a la carte. No more placing individual orders. No more deciding what to prioritize next. We own the roadmap and execute against it every month.

Think of it this way: a la carte is buying ingredients. Managed SEO is hiring the chef.

## Why Managed SEO Requires a Conversation

We do not list pricing on this page because managed SEO is not a one-size product. The scope depends on:

- **Competition level.** A plumber in a small town and a personal injury attorney in Houston have completely different competitive landscapes. The strategy -- and the investment -- should reflect that.
- **Number of locations.** Single-location businesses require different resource allocation than a 10-location franchise.
- **Current SEO health.** A site with solid technical foundations needs a different plan than one with 200 crawl errors and no schema markup.
- **Goals and timeline.** Maintaining current rankings requires less intensity than displacing an entrenched competitor in a saturated market.

We scope every engagement individually so you pay for what your business actually needs -- not a generic tier that oversells some businesses and underserves others.

## What a Strategy Call Looks Like

This is not a sales pitch disguised as a consultation. Here is what happens:

1. **We review your current visibility.** We pull your geo-grid rankings, GBP score, and technical health before the call so we come prepared with data, not questions.
2. **We assess your competitive landscape.** Who are you competing against? What are they doing? Where are the gaps?
3. **We outline a preliminary strategy.** Based on the data, we walk you through what a managed engagement would look like for your business -- scope, timeline, and expected outcomes.
4. **We discuss fit.** Managed SEO is a commitment on both sides. If we don't think we can deliver meaningful results for your business, we will tell you -- and recommend the a la carte products that make more sense.

The call takes 30 minutes. You leave with a clear picture of where you stand and what it would take to dominate your local market.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Is there a minimum contract?**
Managed SEO engagements start with a 90-day commitment. After that, it is month-to-month. The 90-day minimum exists because the CATALYST methodology requires at least three months to execute properly and demonstrate measurable results.

**What if I only need help with one area, like content or GBP?**
That is exactly what our [a la carte products](/services/) are designed for. Managed SEO is for businesses that want comprehensive, hands-off SEO across every channel. If you only need content, check out [Monthly Content](/services/monthly-content/). If you only need GBP, check out [GBP Optimization](/services/gbp-optimization/).

**Can I see reporting samples?**
Yes. On your strategy call, we will show you exactly what a monthly report looks like -- including geo-grid maps, ranking trends, and traffic analysis.

**Do you work with agencies?**
Yes. We offer white-label managed SEO for agencies that want to resell SEO services under their own brand. [Contact us](/managed/?ref=agency) to discuss agency partnerships.

**How is this different from your a la carte products?**
A la carte products are individual deliverables you order as needed. Managed SEO is an ongoing engagement where we own the entire strategy, execute across all channels, and report on results monthly. You get everything in the a la carte catalog, plus strategy, monitoring, and account management.
