## Intro Content

Anyone can claim they're a great local SEO agency. But can they prove it?

LocalCatalyst has helped dozens of local businesses go from invisible to dominant in their markets. We've taken plumbers buried on page 3 and put them at #1 in the Map Pack. We've doubled new patient calls for dentists. We've turned struggling restaurants into neighborhood favorites.

Below are three real case studies showing exactly how we did it — the challenge, the approach, the results, and the timeline. No vanity metrics. No fluff. Just the numbers that matter: rankings, calls, reviews, and revenue.

# CASE STUDY 1: Chicago's Electrician

## Industry: Home Services (Electrical Contracting)  
## Location: Chicago, IL  
## Timeline: February 2025 - July 2025 (6 months)

---

## The Challenge

### H2
`The Problem: Invisible to Local Searchers`

Chicago's Electrician had been in business for 12 years. Great reputation. Loyal customers. But zero online presence.

When we started working with them in February 2025, here's what their local SEO looked like:

**Before LocalCatalyst:**
- **Google Business Profile:** Unclaimed (showed up on Google Maps but wasn't verified)
- **Reviews:** 0 Google reviews
- **Map Pack ranking:** Not ranking in top 10 for any local keywords
- **Organic rankings:** Page 3+ for "electrician Chicago" and related terms
- **Citations:** Listed on only 8 directories (inconsistent NAP data)
- **Website:** 5-page WordPress site, no location pages, no service detail pages
- **Monthly phone calls from search:** ~12 calls/month

Their only marketing was word-of-mouth and repeat customers. When someone searched "emergency electrician Chicago" or "electrician near me," they were invisible.

**The owner's frustration:**  
"I'm losing jobs to electricians who've been in business half as long as me. They're terrible at their job, but they show up at the top of Google and I don't."

# CASE STUDY 2: Prestige Dental Care (Dallas, TX)

## Industry: Medical / Dental  
## Location: Dallas, TX  
## Timeline: March 2025 - August 2025 (6 months)

---

## The Challenge

### H2
`The Problem: Losing Patients to Better-Ranked Competitors`

Prestige Dental Care is a family dentistry practice in Dallas with 8 years in business. Great dentists. Modern office. But their online presence was weak.

**Before LocalCatalyst:**
- **Google Business Profile:** Claimed but barely optimized (incomplete fields, old photos, no posts)
- **Reviews:** 18 Google reviews (4.1-star average)
- **Map Pack ranking:** #7 for "dentist Dallas," not ranking for neighborhood-specific searches
- **Organic rankings:** Page 2 for "family dentist Dallas"
- **Citations:** Listed on 22 directories (inconsistent phone numbers, old address from previous location)
- **Website:** Outdated design, slow page speed (LCP 5.8s), no location pages
- **Monthly new patient calls:** ~22 calls/month

The practice was stable but stagnant. They were losing new patients to competitors who showed up higher in search results.

**The owner's frustration:**  
"Patients tell us they almost didn't call because they saw our competitor had 90 reviews and we only had 18. We're a better practice, but our online presence doesn't show it."

## Timeline: January 2025 - May 2025 (5 months)

---

## The Challenge

### H2
`The Problem: Great Food, Zero Visibility`

Bella Napoli Italian Kitchen is a family-owned Italian restaurant in Miami Beach. Authentic recipes. Cozy atmosphere. Loyal regulars. But struggling to attract new customers.

The restaurant had great food but was invisible to tourists and new locals searching for restaurants online.

**The owner's frustration:**  
"I see people walking past our restaurant, staring at their phones, trying to decide where to eat. They're searching for restaurants on Google. And we're not showing up."
