Most HVAC contractors pour money into Google Ads without understanding which search terms their customers actually use. The difference between ranking for "HVAC repair" and "emergency AC repair near me" can be thousands of dollars in monthly revenue. This guide, part of our complete [HVAC SEO strategy](/industries/hvac-seo/), breaks down exactly which keywords HVAC companies should target, how to find them, and how to build a keyword architecture that converts searchers into booked service calls.

If you want hands-on help building a keyword strategy tailored to your service area, our [local keyword research service](/local-seo-services/local-keyword-research/) handles the entire process.

## Why HVAC Keyword Research Is Different From General SEO

HVAC search behavior is driven by three factors that most industries do not share simultaneously: extreme urgency, sharp seasonality, and hyper-local intent. When a homeowner's furnace dies at 11 PM in January, they are not browsing. They are searching with purchase intent that rivals any industry in local search.

This means HVAC keyword research must account for:

- **Emergency modifiers** that signal immediate buying intent ("24-hour," "emergency," "same-day")
- **Seasonal volume swings** that shift which keywords matter month to month
- **Geo-specific phrasing** that varies by region ("heat pump" dominates the Southeast; "furnace" dominates the Midwest)
- **Equipment-specific long tails** that indicate high-value replacement jobs

Getting these categories wrong means you rank for terms that generate tire-kickers instead of booked appointments.

## The Four HVAC Keyword Categories That Matter

### 1. Emergency and Repair Keywords (Highest Conversion Rate)

These keywords carry the strongest commercial intent in the HVAC industry. Searchers using these terms typically need service within hours, not days.

**High-priority emergency keywords:**
- AC not working
- Furnace not turning on
- Emergency HVAC repair [city]
- AC blowing hot air
- Heater making noise
- No heat in house
- Air conditioner leaking water
- 24-hour AC repair near me

**Why these convert:** Google's own data shows that "near me" searches with urgent modifiers have a conversion rate 2-3x higher than generic service searches. A homeowner searching "AC not working" at 2 PM in July is not comparison shopping.

**Targeting strategy:** Build dedicated landing pages for each emergency scenario. Do not stuff these into a single "repairs" page. A page titled "AC Blowing Hot Air? Same-Day Repair in [City]" will outperform a generic "AC Repair Services" page for that specific query because it matches the searcher's exact problem.

### 2. Seasonal Service Keywords (Highest Volume)

HVAC search volume follows a predictable curve, and the contractors who pre-position content before seasonal spikes capture the lion's share of organic traffic.

**Spring/Summer peak keywords:**
- AC tune-up [city]
- Air conditioning installation
- Central air replacement cost
- SEER rating explained
- AC maintenance plan
- Ductless mini-split installation

**Fall/Winter peak keywords:**
- Furnace tune-up
- Heating system installation
- Furnace replacement cost
- Heat pump vs furnace
- Boiler repair [city]
- Radiant floor heating installation

**Targeting strategy:** Publish seasonal content 60-90 days before peak search volume. A blog post about "When to Schedule Your Spring AC Tune-Up" published in February will have time to index and build authority before March search volume climbs. Waiting until May means competing against established content.

### 3. Installation and Replacement Keywords (Highest Revenue Per Job)

Equipment replacement jobs are the highest-ticket items in residential HVAC, often $5,000-$15,000+. The keywords that drive these leads deserve dedicated, highly optimized pages.

**High-value installation keywords:**
- New AC unit cost [city]
- Furnace replacement near me
- HVAC system installation
- How much does a new HVAC system cost
- Best central air conditioner brands
- Heat pump installation cost
- Ductless mini-split cost

**Targeting strategy:** These searches involve longer decision cycles. Create comparison content ("Heat Pump vs. Furnace: Which Is Right for [Region] Homes?"), cost guides with real price ranges, and brand comparison pages. These searchers will visit your site multiple times before converting, so retargeting and email capture matter here.

### 4. Maintenance and Informational Keywords (Lowest Intent, Highest Volume)

These keywords build topical authority and create entry points into your sales funnel, even though they do not convert directly.

**Informational keywords worth targeting:**
- How often should you change your air filter
- What temperature to set thermostat in winter
- Why is my electric bill so high
- HVAC maintenance checklist
- How long does an AC unit last
- What does SEER rating mean

**Targeting strategy:** Use blog content to capture these searches. Each post should include a natural call-to-action for a maintenance plan or seasonal tune-up. A post answering "How often should you change your air filter?" should end with your maintenance plan offer, because the reader has just demonstrated they care about HVAC upkeep.

## How to Find HVAC Keywords for Your Specific Market

Generic keyword lists are a starting point, not a strategy. Here is how to find the terms that matter in your actual service area.

### Step 1: Mine Google Search Console

If you have an existing website with any organic traffic, Search Console is your most valuable keyword source. Look at the Queries report filtered to the last 12 months. Pay attention to:

- Queries where you rank positions 5-15 (these are your "striking distance" keywords)
- Queries with high impressions but low clicks (your titles or meta descriptions need improvement)
- Queries you rank for accidentally (these reveal content gaps you can fill intentionally)

### Step 2: Analyze Competitor Keywords

Identify the top 3 HVAC companies ranking in your local pack. Use a tool like Semrush or Ahrefs to pull their organic keyword profiles. Look for:

- Keywords they rank for that you do not have pages targeting
- Content formats they use (cost guides, comparison pages, FAQ pages)
- Service area pages they have built for surrounding cities

### Step 3: Use Google's Own Suggestions

Google Autocomplete and "People Also Ask" boxes are free keyword research tools that reflect actual search behavior. Type your core services into Google and document every suggestion:

- "AC repair [city]" + every autocomplete variation
- "Furnace installation" + every "People Also Ask" question
- "HVAC near me" + related searches at the bottom of the results page

### Step 4: Check Google Business Profile Insights

Your GBP dashboard shows which search queries triggered your listing to appear. These are actual terms real customers in your area used. This data is more valuable than any third-party tool because it reflects your specific market.

## Building Your HVAC Keyword Map

A keyword map assigns each target keyword to a specific page on your site. This prevents keyword cannibalization (where multiple pages compete for the same term) and ensures complete coverage.

**Recommended page structure:**

| Page Type | Target Keywords | Example URL |
|-----------|----------------|-------------|
| Homepage | HVAC contractor [city], heating and cooling [city] | / |
| Service page | AC repair [city], air conditioning repair | /ac-repair/ |
| Service page | Furnace repair [city], heating repair | /furnace-repair/ |
| Service page | AC installation [city] | /ac-installation/ |
| Service page | Furnace installation [city] | /furnace-installation/ |
| Service area page | HVAC contractor [nearby city] | /service-areas/[city]/ |
| Blog post | How much does AC repair cost | /blog/ac-repair-cost/ |
| Blog post | How often to service HVAC | /blog/hvac-maintenance-schedule/ |

**Critical rule:** One primary keyword per page. Every page should target one main keyword and 2-4 closely related secondary keywords. If two keywords have nearly identical search results (check by Googling both), they belong on the same page. If the results differ significantly, they need separate pages.

## Keyword Metrics That Actually Matter for HVAC

Not all keywords are worth targeting. Here is how to evaluate which terms deserve your limited time and budget.

**Search volume** matters less than you think. A keyword with 50 monthly searches that converts at 15% is worth more than a keyword with 1,000 monthly searches that converts at 0.5%. In HVAC, low-volume emergency terms often have the highest ROI.

**Keyword difficulty** should be assessed locally, not nationally. A keyword that looks impossible to rank for nationally may be achievable in your metro area. Check who actually ranks in your local results, not who ranks nationally.

**Commercial intent** is the metric most HVAC companies ignore. Prioritize keywords where the searcher is ready to hire. "AC repair near me" has higher commercial intent than "how does an air conditioner work." Both have a place in your strategy, but your budget should favor the former.

## Common HVAC Keyword Mistakes

**Targeting branded terms you do not own.** Ranking for "Carrier AC repair" or "Trane furnace installation" is difficult because manufacturers dominate these results. Instead, target "AC repair [city]" and mention brand expertise in your page content.

**Ignoring long-tail variations.** "AC repair" gets more searches than "AC compressor not working," but the long-tail term tells you exactly what the customer needs, letting you write more specific (and more convincing) content.

**Copying national keyword strategies.** What works for a national HVAC franchise does not work for a local contractor. Your strategy should center on [city] + service combinations, not broad national terms.

**Neglecting seasonal preparation.** If you start creating furnace content in October, you have already lost. Search engines need time to discover, index, and rank new content. Build your seasonal content calendar around a 60-90 day lead time.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How many keywords should an HVAC company target?

A typical HVAC company serving one metro area should actively target 30-50 primary keywords across their site, mapped to individual pages. This includes core service pages (8-12 keywords), service area pages (10-20 keywords based on coverage area), and blog content (10-15 informational keywords). Quality of targeting matters more than quantity.

### Should HVAC companies target "near me" keywords specifically?

You do not need to create separate pages for "near me" variants. Google understands that "AC repair near me" and "AC repair [city]" serve the same intent and will rank the same pages for both. Focus on building strong [city] + [service] pages with proper local SEO signals (Google Business Profile, NAP consistency, local schema markup), and you will capture "near me" traffic automatically.

### How often should I update my HVAC keyword strategy?

Review your keyword performance quarterly using Search Console data. Conduct a full keyword refresh annually, ideally in January, to align your content calendar with seasonal trends. Pay special attention to new service offerings (heat pumps are surging in search volume due to energy efficiency incentives), competitor movements, and changes in Google's local search algorithm.
