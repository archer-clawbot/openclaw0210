# APEX SEO Audit Report
## LocalCatalyst
### darkgreen-moose-683278.hostingersite.com

**Audit Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Prepared By:** LocalCatalyst.ai (Silas - APEX Engine)  
**Audit Type:** Pre-Launch Foundation Audit  
**Auditor:** Silas (APEX SEO Engine)

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

LocalCatalyst is a local SEO agency in pre-launch foundation phase. The website is currently a fresh WordPress installation with zero published content, but **extensive preparatory work has been completed** including full website content, technical specifications, design systems, and competitive analysis. This audit evaluates current live state, prepared assets ready for deployment, and provides a prioritized roadmap to go from 0/10 to 7+/10 within 2-3 weeks.

**Critical Finding:** The site has a **blocking technical issue** (robots.txt disallows Googlebot) that prevents any indexing. Even after content deployment, the site will remain invisible to Google until this is fixed.

**Opportunity:** LocalCatalyst has the rare advantage of launching with full APEX optimization from day one rather than retrofitting a broken site. All content, schema, and technical configurations are documented and ready for immediate implementation.

---

## 2. MASTER SCORECARD

**Scoring Scale:**
- 0-2: Non-existent or critically broken
- 3-4: Minimal setup, major gaps
- 5-6: Partial implementation, clear opportunities
- 7-8: Good, fine-tuning needed
- 9-10: Fully optimized per APEX spec standards

## 5. WEBSITE TECHNICAL AUDIT

### 5.1 Performance

**Unable to measure** — site is live but not generating traffic. Core Web Vitals require real user data.

**Preliminary Load Test (Manual):**
- Homepage loads in ~1.2 seconds (acceptable baseline for empty site)
- Hostinger infrastructure appears responsive
- No obvious performance bottlenecks detected

| Metric | Value | APEX Target | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|
| Page Load Time | ~1200ms | < 2000ms | ✅ Pass (baseline) |
| TTFB | Not measured | < 200ms | Unknown |
| LCP | Not measured | < 2.5s | Unknown |
| CLS | Not measured | < 0.1 | Unknown |
| INP | Not measured | < 200ms | Unknown |
| Document Size | ~50KB | < 500KB | ✅ Pass |

**Recommendation:** Configure GA4 + PageSpeed Insights monitoring post-launch to track real performance data.

### 5.2 Technical Checklist

| Element | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| HTTPS | ✅ Pass | SSL certificate active (Hostinger default) |
| Mobile Responsive | ✅ Pass | Twenty Twenty-Five theme is mobile-responsive |
| Canonical Tags | ❌ Fail | Not present (no SEO plugin installed) |
| Robots.txt | 🔴 **CRITICAL FAIL** | **BLOCKS GOOGLEBOT** — must fix immediately |
| XML Sitemap | ⚠️ Partial | WordPress auto-generates `/sitemap.xml`, but not optimized |
| WWW Redirect | ✅ Pass | Non-www to www redirect configured |
| 404 Page | ✅ Pass | Default WordPress 404 page exists (should be customized) |
| Hreflang | N/A | Single-language site (English) |
| Core Web Vitals | ⚠️ Unknown | No user data available yet |

#### CRITICAL ISSUE: robots.txt Blocks Googlebot

**Current Configuration:**
```
User-agent: Googlebot
Disallow: /

User-agent: *
Allow: /
```

**Impact:** Google's crawler (Googlebot) is explicitly disallowed from the entire domain while other user agents are allowed. This **completely prevents Google from indexing any content.**

**Recommended Fix (IMMEDIATE):**
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

# Disallow access to WordPress admin and sensitive areas
Disallow: /wp-admin/
Disallow: /wp-login.php
Disallow: /wp-includes/
Disallow: /*?s=
Disallow: /*?p=*&cpage
Disallow: /feed/
Disallow: /trackback/
Disallow: /xmlrpc.php

# Allow sitemap
Sitemap: https://darkgreen-moose-683278.hostingersite.com/sitemap.xml
```

**Action:** Replace `/robots.txt` file immediately (BLOCKING issue).

### 5.3 Schema Markup (SPEC-008)

**Current State:** ZERO schema markup detected.

| Schema Type | Present? | Valid? | Notes |

**Prepared Assets:**
- ✅ Full LocalBusiness schema spec (Specs audit 2026-02-10-localbusiness-schema-audit.md)
- ✅ Service schema templates for 4 service pages
- ⚠️ Requires NAP finalization (address, phone, geo coordinates) before implementation

**Recommendation:** Implement LocalBusiness + Organization schema on homepage as soon as NAP is finalized. Add Service schema to each service page during content deployment.

**Score Impact:** 0/10 currently. With implementation: 7/10 (all required schema types present and valid).

## 10. COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS

**Note:** Scout completed a detailed competitive landscape audit (2026-02-10-competitive-landscape-audit.md). Key findings summarized here.

### 10.1 Competitive Positioning

**LocalCatalyst's Differentiation:**
- ✅ 90-day performance guarantee (rare in industry)
- ✅ Transparent pricing (most competitors hide pricing)
- ✅ APEX methodology (proprietary framework)
- ✅ Real-time dashboards (most agencies use monthly PDFs)
- ✅ Service business specialization (narrow niche focus)

**Competitive Gaps to Close:**
- ❌ No case studies yet (competitors have 5-10 published)
- ❌ No reviews yet (competitors have 20-100 reviews)
- ❌ No backlinks yet (competitors have 50-300 referring domains)
- ❌ No content volume yet (competitors have 50-200 blog posts)

### 10.2 Keyword Difficulty Analysis

**Primary Keywords:**

| Keyword | Monthly Searches | Difficulty | Top Competitors |
|---------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| local seo agency | 1,900 | High (65/100) | SEO.co, BrightLocal, LocaliQ |
| seo services | 18,000 | Very High (78/100) | Moz, SEMrush, WebFX |
| google business profile optimization | 880 | Medium (45/100) | Sterling Sky, Whitespark |
| technical seo services | 720 | Medium (50/100) | Merkle, Builtvisible |

**Strategy:** 
- Avoid competing for "seo services" initially (too competitive, too broad)
- Focus on "google business profile optimization" and niche long-tails
- Build authority through blog content on low-competition topics
- Target geo-modified keywords if/when physical location is established
