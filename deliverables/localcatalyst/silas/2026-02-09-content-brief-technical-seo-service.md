### Section 1: What Is Technical SEO? (Educational)
**H2:** What Is Technical SEO and Why It Matters

**Content:**

**Technical SEO** is the foundation of your website's ability to rank. It's the behind-the-scenes optimization that ensures:
- Google can **crawl** your site efficiently
- Google can **index** your pages correctly
- Google can **understand** your content (via schema markup)
- Your site **loads fast** (Core Web Vitals)
- Your site is **mobile-friendly**
- Your site is **secure** (HTTPS, no malware)

**The Problem:**  
You can have the best content in the world, but if your site has technical issues — slow load times, crawl errors, broken schema, duplicate content — Google won't rank you.

**The Opportunity:**  
Most of your competitors have technical SEO problems they don't know about. Fixing them gives you an immediate competitive advantage.

### Section 2: Our Technical SEO Services (What's Included)
**H2:** What's Included in Our Technical SEO Services

**Content:**

We audit and optimize every technical factor Google uses to evaluate your site.

---

#### 1. Core Web Vitals Optimization (SPEC-009)
**What We Do:**
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint):** Optimize images, implement CDN, preload critical assets
- **FID (First Input Delay):** Minimize JavaScript, defer non-critical scripts
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift):** Fix layout shifts, set image/video dimensions
- Real User Monitoring (RUM) data analysis
- Desktop + mobile optimization

**Target Scores:**
- LCP: < 2.5s ✅
- FID: < 100ms ✅
- CLS: < 0.1 ✅

**Why It Matters:**  
Core Web Vitals are a confirmed ranking factor. Sites that pass all three metrics rank higher and retain visitors better (lower bounce rates = more conversions).

**Visual:** Core Web Vitals scorecard (before/after)

---

#### 2. Crawlability & Indexation Audit
**What We Do:**
- Robots.txt analysis and optimization
- XML sitemap audit and restructuring
- Crawl budget optimization
- JavaScript rendering issues (dynamic content indexation)
- Orphan page detection and internal link fixes
- Redirect chain audits (301/302 cleanup)
- Parameter handling (URL parameters causing duplicate content)
- Log file analysis (identify what Googlebot is actually crawling)

**Why It Matters:**  
If Google can't crawl your pages, they can't rank. We ensure every important page is discoverable, and no crawl budget is wasted on low-value pages.

---

#### 3. Schema Markup Implementation (SPEC-008)
**What We Do:**
- **LocalBusiness schema** (for local businesses)
- **Organization schema** (brand identity)
- **Service schema** (for each service offering)
- **Product schema** (for e-commerce)
- **Review/AggregateRating schema** (star ratings in search results)
- **FAQ schema** (featured snippet opportunities)
- **Article schema** (blog posts)
- **Breadcrumb schema** (enhanced search result appearance)
- **Event schema** (if applicable)
- **VideoObject schema** (for video content)

**Validation:**  
- Google Rich Results Test
- Schema.org validator
- Ongoing monitoring for errors

**Why It Matters:**  
Schema is how you "speak" to Google in its native language. It helps Google understand your business, services, and content — leading to rich results, enhanced snippets, and better AI Overview visibility.

---

#### 4. Site Architecture & Internal Linking
**What We Do:**
- Information architecture analysis
- URL structure optimization
- Internal linking strategy (hub-and-spoke model)
- Siloing for topical authority
- Pagination and faceted navigation handling
- Canonical tag implementation
- Noindex/nofollow strategic deployment

**Why It Matters:**  
Your site structure determines how PageRank flows and how Google understands your content hierarchy. Strategic internal linking boosts rankings for priority pages.

---

#### 5. Mobile Optimization & Responsive Design
**What We Do:**
- Mobile-first indexing compliance
- Viewport configuration
- Touch target sizing
- Mobile usability error fixes
- AMP implementation (if needed)
- Progressive Web App (PWA) assessment

**Why It Matters:**  
Google uses mobile-first indexing — your mobile site IS your primary site. If it's not optimized, you won't rank.

---

#### 6. Site Speed Optimization
**What We Do:**
- Image optimization (WebP conversion, lazy loading, responsive images)
- CSS/JS minification and compression
- Browser caching configuration
- CDN implementation (Cloudflare, etc.)
- Database optimization (for CMS sites)
- Server response time optimization
- Critical rendering path optimization
- Third-party script audit (remove performance hogs)

**Target:** < 2.5s LCP on mobile

**Why It Matters:**  
Site speed is a ranking factor AND a conversion factor. A 1-second delay in load time can reduce conversions by 7%.

---

#### 7. HTTPS & Security
**What We Do:**
- SSL certificate implementation and renewal
- Mixed content fixes (HTTP → HTTPS)
- Security header implementation (HSTS, CSP)
- Malware/hack recovery (if infected)
- Security monitoring and alerts

**Why It Matters:**  
HTTPS is a ranking signal. Unsecure sites (HTTP) are penalized and flagged in browsers, destroying trust.

---

#### 8. Duplicate Content & Canonicalization
**What We Do:**
- Duplicate content audit (across your site and scrapers)
- Canonical tag strategy
- Parameter handling (e.g., `?utm_source=` tracking parameters)
- Syndication and content licensing management
- Pagination handling (rel=next/prev or canonical to view-all)

**Why It Matters:**  
Duplicate content dilutes ranking signals. Google doesn't know which version to rank, so often none of them rank well.

---

#### 9. International & Multi-Location SEO (if applicable)
**What We Do:**
- Hreflang implementation (for multi-language sites)
- GeoIP redirect strategy
- Multi-location schema markup
- Regional sitemap structuring

**Why It Matters:**  
If you serve multiple countries or languages, proper hreflang prevents duplicate content issues and ensures the right version ranks in each market.

---

### Section 7: FAQ (Schema Opportunity)
**H2:** Technical SEO Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What's the difference between technical SEO and on-page SEO?**  
A: Technical SEO focuses on site infrastructure (speed, crawlability, schema, mobile-friendliness). On-page SEO focuses on content (titles, headings, keyword optimization, content quality). Both are necessary.

**Q: How long does a technical SEO audit take?**  
A: For sites under 10,000 pages, we deliver audits within 7-10 days. Larger sites (50K+ pages) may take 2-3 weeks for comprehensive analysis.

**Q: Can you fix technical issues on any CMS?**  
A: Yes. We work with WordPress, Shopify, Webflow, Wix, custom-built sites, and enterprise platforms. Some platforms have limitations, which we'll communicate upfront.

**Q: Will fixing technical SEO improve my rankings immediately?**  
A: Critical fixes (crawl blockers, indexation issues) can show impact within days. Core Web Vitals and schema improvements typically show ranking impact within 4-8 weeks as Google re-crawls and re-evaluates your site.

**Q: Do I need technical SEO if my site is new?**  
A: Yes — it's easier (and cheaper) to build it right from the start than to fix it later. New sites should have technical SEO baked in from day one.

**Q: What tools do you use for technical SEO?**  
A: Screaming Frog, Sitebulb, Ahrefs, Google Search Console, PageSpeed Insights, Schema.org validator, Google Rich Results Test, Chrome DevTools, and proprietary scripts.
