### Section 1: What Is Local SEO? (Educational)
**H2:** What Is Local SEO and Why Does Your Business Need It?

**Content:**

Local SEO is the process of optimizing your online presence to rank higher in local search results — specifically the **Google Map Pack**, the 3-business showcase that appears when someone searches for services near them.

**Why It Matters:**
- 46% of all Google searches have local intent
- 76% of people who search for something nearby visit a business within 24 hours
- 28% of local searches result in a purchase
- **If you're not in the Map Pack, you're losing customers to competitors who are**

**What Makes Local SEO Different:**
- **National SEO** targets broad keywords ("running shoes")
- **Local SEO** targets geo-specific queries ("running shoes near me", "shoe store Chicago")
- Requires Google Business Profile optimization, local citations, geo-targeted content, and location-specific schema

**Visual:** Comparison table (National SEO vs Local SEO)

### Section 2: Our Local SEO Services (What's Included)
**H2:** What's Included in Our Local SEO Services

**Content:**

Our local SEO service is comprehensive — we optimize every signal Google uses to rank local businesses.

#### 1. Google Business Profile (GBP) Optimization
**What We Do:**
- Complete GBP audit and optimization
- Custom service entries engineered as micro-landing pages (SPEC-001)
- 750-character description with Local Hub Gambit targeting (SPEC-002)
- Strategic Q&A seeding for pre-emptive ranking (SPEC-003)
- Products tab optimization for conversion (SPEC-004)
- 3x/week posting cadence with AI Overview seeding (SPEC-005)

**Why It Matters:**  
Your GBP is the #1 ranking factor for Map Pack visibility. Most businesses claim their profile and stop — we turn it into a conversion machine.

---

#### 2. Citation Building & NAP Consistency
**What We Do:**
- Audit existing citations for NAP (Name, Address, Phone) inconsistencies
- Submit to 50+ high-authority directories (Yelp, BBB, Apple Maps, etc.)
- Fix duplicate or incorrect listings
- Data aggregator submissions (Neustar, Factual, Acxiom)
- Ongoing citation monitoring

**Why It Matters:**  
Inconsistent NAP data confuses Google and dilutes your ranking signals. Citations are trust signals — the more authoritative directories listing your business, the more Google trusts you.

---

#### 3. Review Generation & Management
**What We Do:**
- Automated review request campaigns
- Custom review landing pages
- Review response protocol (responding to all reviews within 24 hours)
- Sentiment monitoring and reputation management
- Strategy to overcome negative reviews

**Why It Matters:**  
Google factors review quantity, recency, velocity, and sentiment into rankings. Businesses with 50+ reviews and 4.5+ stars dominate the Map Pack.

---

#### 4. Geo-Grid Rank Tracking
**What We Do:**
- Weekly geo-grid scans across your service area
- SoLV (Share of Local Voice) scoring
- WVS (Weighted Visibility Score) analysis
- Heat maps showing where you rank vs competitors
- Trend analysis and competitive displacement monitoring

**Why It Matters:**  
Most agencies track rankings from one location. We track from dozens of points across your service area to show true market coverage — the metric that correlates with revenue.

---

#### 5. Location-Based Content Strategy
**What We Do:**
- Semantic location silos (city hub + neighborhood spokes) (SPEC-006)
- Grounding boxes optimized for AI Overviews (SPEC-007)
- Internal linking architecture for topical authority
- Geo-targeted blog content

**Why It Matters:**  
Your website needs to prove to Google that you serve specific areas. Generic "we serve [city]" pages don't work — you need deep, structured content demonstrating local expertise.

---

#### 6. Local Link Building
**What We Do:**
- Local business partnerships and co-marketing
- Chamber of Commerce & local association links
- Local news and PR placements
- Sponsorships and event link opportunities
- Geo-specific directory submissions

**Why It Matters:**  
Local backlinks from authoritative local sources (news sites, .gov, .edu, local blogs) signal to Google that you're embedded in the community.

---

#### 7. Schema Markup for Local Businesses
**What We Do:**
- LocalBusiness schema implementation
- Service schema for each service offering
- Review schema (aggregate ratings)
- FAQ schema for common questions
- BreadcrumbList schema for site navigation

**Why It Matters:**  
Schema helps Google understand your business, services, and location. Properly implemented schema increases chances of rich results and enhances AI Overview visibility.

---

### Section 7: FAQ (Schema Opportunity)
**H2:** Local SEO Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How long does local SEO take to see results?**  
A: Quick wins (GBP optimization, citation fixes) can show movement within 2-4 weeks. Significant Map Pack ranking improvements typically occur within 8-12 weeks. Full market domination (50%+ SoLV) takes 3-6 months depending on competition.

**Q: Do you guarantee #1 rankings?**  
A: We don't guarantee specific rankings (no ethical agency does), but we guarantee measurable improvement in your SoLV (Share of Local Voice) within 90 days or we continue working at no cost until we do.

**Q: What if I don't have a physical location?**  
A: Service-area businesses (SABs) can still dominate local search. We optimize your GBP as a SAB and build geo-specific content to establish service area authority.

**Q: How is local SEO different from regular SEO?**  
A: Local SEO prioritizes Map Pack rankings, GBP optimization, local citations, and geo-targeted content. Regular (national) SEO focuses on organic rankings for broad keywords without location modifiers.

**Q: Can I do local SEO myself?**  
A: You can handle basics (claim GBP, get reviews), but advanced tactics (geo-grid optimization, schema engineering, citation consistency across 100+ directories, AI Overview positioning) require specialized tools and expertise.

**Q: What industries do you work with?**  
A: We specialize in service-based local businesses: home services (HVAC, plumbing, electrical), professional services (law, accounting, medical), retail, restaurants, and automotive.
