# GBP Completeness Audit — Implementation Summary
**Date:** February 14, 2026  
**Agent:** Wrench (Technical Implementation)  
**Status:** ⏳ BLOCKED — Awaiting NAP Data from Operator  
**Domain:** darkgreen-moose-683278.hostingersite.com  

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The GBP completeness audit from Silas is comprehensive and well-prepared. However, **implementation is BLOCKED** by missing business data that only the operator can provide.

**Current State:**
- ✅ WordPress site is live and fully built
- ✅ Organization schema exists but is incomplete
- ❌ **CRITICAL BLOCKER:** Missing NAP information (address, phone, hours, service area)
- ✅ GBP content is 100% prepared and ready to deploy
- ❌ GBP profile does not exist (not yet claimed)

**What Can Be Done:**
1. ✅ Verify WordPress is ready for schema updates (DONE)
2. ✅ Prepare REST API calls for schema updates (READY)
3. ❌ Execute schema updates (BLOCKED — need NAP data)
4. ❌ Claim GBP (BLOCKED — need NAP data, plus requires google.com/business access)

**Timeline:**
- **TODAY:** Wait for operator to provide NAP data
- **TOMORROW:** Once data provided, execute schema updates (1-2 hours)
- **DAY 3+:** Operator claims GBP and uploads content (outside WordPress)

## CURRENT WORDPRESS STATUS ✅

### Schema Verification

The homepage contains Organization schema (confirmed via curl):

```json
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Organization",
  "name": "LocalCatalyst",
  "url": "https://darkgreen-moose-683278.hostingersite.com/",
  "logo": "https://darkgreen-moose-683278.hostingersite.com/wp-content/themes/localcatalyst/img/logo.png",
  "description": "AI-powered SEO deliverables for local businesses. Transparent pricing, autonomous production, results you can measure.",
  "sameAs": [],
  "contactPoint": {
    "@type": "ContactPoint",
    "contactType": "Customer Support",
    "url": "https://darkgreen-moose-683278.hostingersite.com/contact/"
  },
  "address": {
    "@type": "PostalAddress",
    "addressCountry": "US"
  }
}
```

### Current Schema Status

| Field | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| name | ✅ Present | "LocalCatalyst" |
| url | ✅ Present | Correct domain |
| logo | ✅ Present | Correct path |
| description | ✅ Present | Adequate description |
| **sameAs** | ❌ **EMPTY** | Should contain GBP URL (cannot add until GBP is claimed) |
| contactPoint | ⚠️ **INCOMPLETE** | Has ContactPoint type but no telephone property |
| **address.streetAddress** | ❌ **MISSING** | Required for full schema |
| **address.addressLocality** | ❌ **MISSING** | Required for full schema |
| **address.addressRegion** | ❌ **MISSING** | Required for full schema |
| **address.postalCode** | ❌ **MISSING** | Required for full schema |
| **address.addressCountry** | ✅ Present | "US" (correct) |

### Verification Result

**Schema is partially complete.** It provides basic organization information but is missing:
1. Street address
2. City
3. State/Region
4. ZIP code
5. Phone number

**These fields are required to fully satisfy the GBP audit recommendations.**

---

## REQUIRED DATA FOR IMPLEMENTATION

The audit explicitly identifies these as **MISSING** and required before GBP setup:

| Data Point | Required For | Status | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Physical Address** | Schema + GBP verification | ❌ MISSING | "123 Business St" |
| **City** | Schema + GBP verification | ❌ MISSING | "Chicago" |
| **State** | Schema + GBP verification | ❌ MISSING | "IL" or "Illinois" |
| **ZIP Code** | Schema + GBP verification | ❌ MISSING | "60614" |
| **Phone Number** | Schema + Website footer + GBP | ❌ MISSING | "(312) 555-1234" |
| **Service Area** | GBP listing | ❌ MISSING | "Chicago, Evanston, Oak Park" |
| **Business Hours** | GBP listing | ❌ MISSING | "Mon-Fri 9AM-5PM CT" |

**Blocking Status:** ❌ **ALL CRITICAL** — GBP cannot be claimed without this data

## WHAT'S NOT POSSIBLE VIA WORDPRESS

The following GBP recommendations **cannot be executed via WordPress REST API**:

| Task | Reason | Owner | Timeline |
|------|--------|-------|----------|
| Claim GBP listing | Requires google.com/business access | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Upload cover photo | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Upload business photos | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Add service entries | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Seed Q&A entries | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Configure products | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Schedule posts | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Request verification postcard | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |
| Enter verification code | GBP-specific, not WordPress | Operator | Day 3+ |

**All of these are handled directly in Google Business Profile, not WordPress.**

## BLOCKERS & DEPENDENCIES

### Blocker #1: Missing NAP Information ❌ CRITICAL

**What's needed:**
- Business street address
- Business city
- Business state
- Business ZIP code
- Business phone number
- Service area (cities/states served)
- Business hours (Mon-Fri, Sat, Sun availability)

**Who can provide:** Operator / Business Owner  
**Timeline needed:** ASAP (blocks schema update execution)

### Blocker #2: No GBP Yet Claimed ❌ CRITICAL

**Current state:** No Google Business Profile exists  
**Required to proceed:** NAP information (above)  
**Who does it:** Operator (requires google.com/business access)  
**Timeline:** 30+ days (including USPS verification postcard delivery)

### Blocker #3: Schema Update Mechanism 🔄 UNCERTAIN

**Issue:** The Organization schema appears to be generated by the WordPress theme or a plugin, not stored directly as post metadata.  
**May require:** Direct WordPress option update or theme configuration  
**Status:** Need to identify schema generation source before executing updates

---

## RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Step 1: Request NAP Data from Operator (TODAY)
Send the business context form (from Technical SEO task):
- [ ] Business address
- [ ] Business city
- [ ] Business state
- [ ] Business ZIP code
- [ ] Business phone number
- [ ] Service area
- [ ] Business hours

**Form location:** `C:\Users\spart\.openclaw\deliverables\localcatalyst\wrench\SILAS-BUSINESS-CONTEXT-FORM.md`  
**Deadline:** ASAP (ideally today, required by tomorrow)

---

### Step 2: Identify Schema Generation Source (PARALLEL)
Determine how the Organization schema is being generated:
- [ ] Is it from a WordPress plugin (RankMath, Yoast, etc.)?
- [ ] Is it from the theme (custom theme code)?
- [ ] Is it from WordPress core settings?

**Method:** Check WordPress admin → Plugins, check theme files, check post/site options.

**Importance:** Affects how we update the schema via REST API.

---

### Step 3: Execute Schema Updates (Once Data Received)
Once NAP data is available:
1. [ ] Update Organization schema with street address
2. [ ] Update Organization schema with city
3. [ ] Update Organization schema with state
4. [ ] Update Organization schema with ZIP code
5. [ ] Update ContactPoint schema with phone number
6. [ ] Verify all changes via REST API GET request

**Timeline:** 1-2 hours  
**Verification:** Confirm updated schema appears on homepage

---

### Step 4: GBP Claim & Setup (Outside WordPress)
Once WordPress is updated:
1. Operator opens google.com/business
2. Operator claims new GBP listing for LocalCatalyst
3. Operator enters NAP information
4. Operator selects categories and uploads photos
5. Operator pastes pre-prepared content (description, services, Q&A)
6. Operator requests verification postcard
7. Operator waits 5-14 days for postcard
8. Operator enters verification code
9. GBP goes live

**Timeline:** 30+ days (USPS delivery time is the bottleneck)

---

### Step 5: Update WordPress with GBP URL (After Claim)
Once GBP is claimed and verified:
1. [ ] Get GBP URL from verified listing
2. [ ] Update `sameAs` array in Organization schema
3. [ ] Verify update appears on homepage

**Timeline:** 10 minutes  
**Dependency:** Must wait until GBP is claimed (Step 4)

## KEY FINDINGS FROM AUDIT

### What's Working ✅
- WordPress site is fully built and professional
- Organization schema foundation is present
- GBP content is 100% prepared and ready
- Service pages are published and optimized
- Meta tags are configured
- Logo is deployed

### What Needs Work ⚠️
- Organization schema is incomplete (missing address fields)
- ContactPoint is missing phone number
- Website footer doesn't display phone number
- sameAs array is empty (will be populated after GBP claim)

### What's Blocked ❌
- Completing Organization schema (need NAP data)
- Adding phone to website (need NAP data)
- Claiming GBP (need NAP data)
- Uploading GBP content (need google.com/business access)

---

## SUMMARY: Why Implementation is Blocked

**The audit contains excellent recommendations, but they require business information that doesn't exist yet.**

The operator needs to decide:
1. **What is the business address?** (required for GBP verification postcard)
2. **What is the business phone?** (required for schema and GBP)
3. **What cities/states will be served?** (required for GBP service area)
4. **What are business hours?** (required for GBP listing)

**Without these decisions, Wrench cannot:**
- Complete the Organization schema
- Add phone number to website
- Claim a GBP on behalf of the operator
- Configure GBP with correct information

**This is a business decision, not a technical implementation issue.**

---

## NEXT CRITICAL MILESTONE

**By Tomorrow (Feb 15) 10:00 AM:**
- [ ] Operator has completed and submitted business context form
- [ ] NAP information is finalized
- [ ] Wrench has identified schema generation mechanism
- [ ] Ready to execute Phase 3 (WordPress schema updates)

**If this deadline is not met:**
- Implementation will be delayed another 24 hours
- GBP claim timeline will slip to Feb 17+
- Loss of momentum on GBP optimization work

**Escalation:** If NAP data not received by tomorrow 10 AM, escalate to Archer for urgency communication with operator.
