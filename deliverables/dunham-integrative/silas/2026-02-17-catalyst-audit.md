## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Dunham Integrative Health + Aesthetics is a medically-supervised aesthetic and wellness practice in Glenville, NY (Capital Region), offering a broad menu of services including injectables, body contouring, IV therapy, hormone optimization, and professional skincare — led by Amanda Dunham, DNP, FNP-C, a master injector with 15+ years of experience. Their current SEO posture is early-stage: the website is functional and service-rich but built on GoDaddy Website Builder with zero structured schema, a broken canonical structure, a thin meta/OG layer, no blog, no city silo architecture, and alarmingly low indexation (~5 pages of 25 indexed). The single biggest thing holding them back is the combination of missing LocalBusiness schema + GBP content deficiencies + NAP fragmentation across multiple name variants — a triple-threat that makes Google unsure of who this business is, where they are, and what they do.

| botox near me Capital Region | Not in Top 10 | Rejuva Center, Artistry of Face | Competitors have 200–600 more Google reviews, stronger DA |

## 4. GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE AUDIT

### 4.1 GBP Status

| Element | Status | Score Impact |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Listing Exists | Likely Yes (indirect evidence via Wheree, Jane App, Fresha) | Must verify via direct GBP login |
| Verified | Unknown | Requires operator access to confirm |
| Primary Category | Unknown — likely "Medical Spa" or "Aesthetic Medical Center" | If "Aesthetician" only, needs upgrade |
| Secondary Categories | Unknown | Likely missing or minimal |
| Address Visible | Likely Yes | 19 Glenridge Rd, Glenville, NY 12302 |
| Phone Number | (518) 579-0012 | Verify consistency across all GBP fields |
| Website Link | dunhamintegrativefh.com | Confirm pointing to primary domain, not Jane App |
| Business Hours | Unknown in GBP | Hours confirmed on site: Mon-Tue, Thu-Fri 9am-4pm; Thu extended to 7pm |
| Service Areas | Unknown | Should include: Glenville, Schenectady, Latham, Albany, Saratoga Springs, Halfmoon, Clifton Park, Malta, Niskayuna |

**GBP Discovery Notes:**
- GBP was NOT directly surfaced in the first SERP for "[business name] Glenville NY" — this is a red flag for pack visibility
- The Jane App location page (dunhamintegrative.janeapp.com) is outranking the main site for brand + city queries — authority is split
- Fresha, Wheree, BTL directory, Tebra, and Thorne all reference the business — confirming existence but not GBP optimization status
- **Operator must confirm GBP verification and provide access for optimization**

### 4.2 GBP Content

| Element | Count/Status | Quality Assessment |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Photos | Unknown | Requires GBP access; likely fewer than 50 based on limited SERP photo presence |
| Posts (last 30 days) | 0 confirmed | No GBP posts detected in any search result |
| Q&A | Unknown | No owner-seeded Q&A found in searches; likely 0 or organic-only |
| Products | Likely 0 | No product entries detected in any search surface |
| Services | Unknown | May exist but not surfaced as micro-landing entries |
| Description | Unknown | Not appearing in search snippets; likely not keyword-optimized |

### 4.3 Reviews

| Platform | Count | Average Rating | Response Rate |
|----------|-------|---------------|---------------|
| Google (GBP) | UNKNOWN — requires manual check | Unknown | Unknown |
| Yelp | ~1-10 (stale/fragmented listings) | Unknown | Unknown |
| Fresha | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |
| Tebra | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |
| Facebook | Unknown | Unknown | Unknown |
| Wheree | Listed | Described positively in aggregated review | Unknown |

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Review count/rating for the primary GBP could not be confirmed via search — this indicates the GBP is either not well-indexed by Google or the review volume is low enough to not generate star snippets in search results. Competitors have 297–613 reviews. This is a significant competitive gap.

## 5. WEBSITE TECHNICAL AUDIT

### 5.1 Performance

| Metric | Value | CATALYST Target | Status |
|--------|-------|-------------|--------|

**Note:** Site is built on GoDaddy Website Builder 8.0.0 (confirmed in meta generator tag). This platform typically scores in the 45–65 range on Google PageSpeed Mobile, with LCP commonly failing. Full CWV verification requires PageSpeed Insights or CrUX data pull — flagged for Wrench.

| Indexable Login Pages | ❌ FAIL | /m/login, /m/reset, /m/create are in sitemap and should be noindexed |

## 6. ON-PAGE SEO AUDIT (SPEC-010)

### 6.1 Homepage Meta

| Element | Content | Length | Assessment |
|---------|---------|--------|------------|
| Title Tag | "Welcome \| Dunham Integrative Health + Aesthetics" | ~50 chars | **FAIL** — Leading with "Welcome" wastes the most valuable SEO real estate; no service term, no geo modifier. Should be: "Med Spa Glenville NY \| Botox, Fillers & Aesthetics \| Dunham Integrative" |
| Meta Description | "Explore Dunham Integrative Health + Aesthetics for personalized medical spa services. Discover beauty and wellness tailored just for you!" | ~139 chars | **FAIL** — No geo term, no specific service keywords, no CTA that uses relevant language; "tailored just for you" is filler. Should include: Glenville, NY + 2-3 top services + booking CTA |
| H1 | Not directly confirmed (GoDaddy Builder renders dynamically) | Unknown | Requires browser render check — likely brand name only with no geo/service term |
| OG Title | "Dunham Integrative Health + Aesthetics" | ~40 chars | PARTIAL — Brand name OK, but no keyword/geo context for social sharing |
| OG Description | "Rebuild Collagen and Improve Skin From Within\nSchedule your treatment today!" | ~75 chars | **FAIL** — Extremely thin; no location, no primary services, no differentiator |
| OG URL | https://dunhamintegrativefh.com/welcome | — | **FAIL** — Should point to canonical homepage (/), not /welcome |
| OG Image | Getty stock image (isteam/getty/2237251168) | — | **FAIL** — Using a stock photo for social sharing; should be a branded photo of the practice or team |
| Twitter Card | summary | — | **PARTIAL** — Present but should be "summary_large_image" for better social display |
| Twitter Description | "NAD+ and RF Microneedling\nCapital region ny" | ~42 chars | **FAIL** — Incoherent, incomplete sentence; looks like a draft or test value left in production |

### 6.2 Image SEO

| Metric | Value | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------|
| Total Images | Est. 20-40 | GoDaddy Builder uses hosted image CDN (img1.wsimg.com) |
| Images with Alt Text | Unknown — requires render | GoDaddy Builder auto-generates some alt text; quality variable |
| CSS Background Images | Unknown | Common in GoDaddy Builder hero sections — SEO invisible |
| Image Compression | GoDaddy CDN handles | Served via wsimg.com CDN with responsive sizing; reasonable |
| WebP/AVIF Usage | Partial | GoDaddy's isteam CDN supports WebP conversion but may not be enabled |
| Branded Photos | ❌ Missing | OG image is Getty stock; social/marketing images may also be stock-heavy |

### 6.3 E-E-A-T Assessment

```
Experience (E1):       4/10 × 0.20 = 0.80
  — Team bios exist with years of experience; Amanda has 15+ yrs/DNP
  — No patient testimonials embedded on service pages
  — No before/after gallery schema or case study content

Expertise (E2):        5/10 × 0.25 = 1.25
  — Amanda Dunham's credentials are strong (DNP, FNP-C, trainer/consultant)
  — Team page lists certifications but these are not cross-linked to service pages
  — No authored content/blog; no external expert citations
  — No professional association badges (AANP, IFM, NYSNA mentioned in bio only)

Authoritativeness (A): 3/10 × 0.25 = 0.75
  — No editorial backlinks from medical or beauty publications
  — Brand presence is fragmented across 4+ name variants
  — No Wikipedia, Crunchbase, or authority-site profiles found
  — BTL Provider directory listing is a plus (authoritative brand partnership)

Trustworthiness (T):   4/10 × 0.30 = 1.20
  — HTTPS: ✅
  — Privacy policy: ✅
  — Non-discrimination policy: ✅
  — No visible patient reviews/star ratings on website
  — No SSL certificate trust seal
  — No licensing info displayed (NP license number)
  — NAP fragmentation undermines trust signals
──────────────────────────────────────
Composite E-E-A-T Score:  4.0/10
```

**Top 3 E-E-A-T gaps:**
1. **No authored content demonstrating expertise** — Amanda Dunham's credentials are extensive but locked in a team bio page; no blog posts, no educational articles, no expert quotes in media → Add monthly educational blog posts authored by Amanda (SPEC-010)
2. **No social proof on-page** — No review widgets, testimonial sections, or star ratings on service pages; prospective patients have no on-site validation signals → Embed Google review widget + add 3-5 testimonials per service page (SPEC-012)
3. **Authoritativeness signal gap** — No media mentions, no press, no backlinks from health/aesthetics publications; business name fragmentation hurts entity confidence → Entity consolidation + PR outreach to Capital Region media (SPEC-014)

**AI content risk:** LOW — Content appears human-written and practice-authentic; no AI-generated content markers detected.

### 6.4 Content Quality Signals

| Signal | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Unique Content per Page | Partial | Service pages have original prose; some sections repeat across pages |
| Grounding Boxes Present | ❌ No | No AI-snippet-optimized Q&A or summary boxes on any page (SPEC-007) |
| Location Silos Structured | ❌ No | No city hub or spoke pages for Glenville, Schenectady, Albany, Latham, Saratoga (SPEC-006) |
| External Authority Links | ~1-2 | Links to jane app and possibly 1-2 product pages; no .gov/.edu links |
| Internal Link Structure | ⚠️ Weak | Most CTAs link to Jane App subdomain, not internal pages; poor topical clustering |
| Thin Content Pages | 5-8 est. | /contact, /privacy-policy, /patient-intake, /covid-19, /m/* pages are thin |
| Duplicate Content Risk | Low-Medium | Service page content partially overlaps; /welcome and homepage may have canonical duplication |
| Blog / Content Hub | ❌ Absent | Zero blog posts; no FAQ articles; no educational content |
| Topical Authority | ❌ Weak | Single-layer site with no content depth beyond service descriptions |

### 7.3 Competitor Comparison

| Metric | Dunham Integrative | Rejuva Center at Williams | Hebe Medical Spa | Artistry of Face |
|--------|-------------------|--------------------------|------------------|-----------------|

- **Geographic targeting**: Dunham targets Glenville only; Rejuva Center and Artistry of Face have multi-city SEO pages
- **Membership differentiation**: This is Dunham's unique advantage (membership model) — not being leveraged in SEO content

## 8. AI VISIBILITY (SPEC-017)

### 8.1 GEO Assessment

**Test queries evaluated:**

| Test | Cited? | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| "best medspa in Glenville NY" AI Overview | No | Not cited; no AI Overview appeared for this niche query |
| "botox near me Capital Region NY" AI Overview | No | Competitors with higher review counts and authority likely cited |
| "IV hydration therapy Glenville NY" AI Overview | No | Dunham ranks organically but no AI Overview box captured |
| "hormone optimization Schenectady NY" | No | Parasite SEO sites dominate; Dunham not present |
| "Dunham Integrative Health Aesthetics" | Partial | Brand query returns website but no Knowledge Panel or AI summary |

| Platform | Q1 | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Q5 | Raw (/25) | Weighted |
|----------|----|----|----|----|----|----|---------|
| Google AI Overview | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 2/25 | × 0.35 = 0.35 |
| ChatGPT | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/25 | × 0.25 = 0.00 |
| Perplexity | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1/25 | × 0.20 = 0.10 |
| Copilot | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/25 | × 0.10 = 0.00 |
| Siri/Apple | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0/25 | × 0.10 = 0.00 |

**GEO Composite Score: 0.45/10** *(ESTIMATED — verify with direct LLM testing. Score based on entity signal analysis and search surface absence.)*

**Root cause of low AI visibility:**
1. No LocalBusiness schema — AI systems cannot reliably entity-match this business
2. No structured FAQ/educational content — nothing for AI to excerpt and attribute
3. NAP fragmentation — AI systems get conflicting entity signals across data sources
4. No Wikipedia/Wikidata presence, no authority publication mentions
5. Review gap vs competitors makes them less likely to be referenced as "best" or "recommended"

| Week 2 | Schema deployed, canonical fixed, GBP description + Q&A live | Schema validation in GSC; GBP description visible in search |

## 12. INVESTMENT & ROI PROJECTION

| Service | Monthly Cost | Duration |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Full CATALYST Management (Routes 1-5 + AI/XP) | $[TBD — standard agency rate] | 6-month minimum |
| Priority Tier 1 Sprint (Schema + GBP + Citations + Reviews) | One-time build + first month | Month 1 |
| Content Production (blog 4x/month + city pages) | Included or add-on | Ongoing |

**Projected ROI Basis:**
- Medspa industry average patient LTV: $1,200–$3,600/year (membership + services)
- If SEO generates 5 new patients/month by Month 3: 60 new patients/year × $2,000 avg LTV = $120,000 additional annual revenue
- Botox membership alone at $150-300/month × 20 new members = $36,000-$72,000 ARR
- ROI positive by Month 3 if review velocity and schema deployment execute as planned

## 13. CONCLUSION

Dunham Integrative Health + Aesthetics is a high-quality practice with a legitimate competitive advantage — a medical-grade membership model, a DNP-credentialed lead provider with specialized expertise in biostimulators and regenerative aesthetics, and a broad service menu that few local competitors match. The problem isn't the practice; it's the digital infrastructure. Zero schema, a broken canonical structure, a crippled robots.txt, only 5 indexed pages of 25, a stale NAP spread across 4+ name variants, and likely under 20 Google reviews put them at the bottom of Google's trust hierarchy while Hebe (613 reviews) and Rejuva Center (297 reviews) dominate the local pack. If they do nothing, organic growth will remain flat and the review gap with competitors will only widen — their superior clinical offerings will remain invisible to the 78% of patients who use Google to find medspa services. If they execute Tier 1 tasks within the first two weeks — schema, canonical fix, GBP optimization, NAP normalization, and review generation — they will see measurable improvements in indexation and GBP visibility within 30 days, with Map Pack entry achievable within 90 days. **The single highest-leverage action right now is deploying LocalBusiness schema and launching a review generation campaign simultaneously.** These two tasks alone will move the CATALYST score from 2.3 to approximately 4.5 within 60 days.
