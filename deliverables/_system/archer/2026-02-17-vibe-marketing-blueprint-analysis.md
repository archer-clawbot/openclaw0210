# Vibe Marketing Blueprint Analysis (YouTube)
**Source:** https://youtu.be/b1mjQIiH7r4  
**Date:** 2026-02-17  
**Speakers:** Greg Eisenberg + Jonathan (AJ & Smart, facilitator.com)  
**Context:** CEO framework for turning vibe-coded products into revenue using AI

---

## Executive Summary

Non-technical CEO perspective on using AI for marketing and revenue — not just building. Core thesis: **Your job as CEO is promoter first, builder second.** AI is a support tool for the promoter framework, not a replacement for it.

Key outcome: Jonathan runs webinar campaigns generating $250K-$500K per event using this framework. Full process from idea to landing page now takes half a day (was 2-3 days).

## The Promoter Blueprint (4-Step Framework)

### The Core Framework
```
TRAFFIC → HOLDING PATTERN → SELLING EVENT → (back to holding if no conversion)
```

### Step 1: Traffic Generation (Organic or Paid)

**Organic:**
- Go on other people's podcasts (primary strategy)
- Post on social media (X, LinkedIn)
- Run events, networking
- Create free content (YouTube, blog)

**Paid:**
- Meta ads
- TikTok, YouTube ads
- Retargeting existing email list (lookalike audiences)

**Key Rule:** Don't push traffic directly to product. Push to holding pattern first.

### Step 2: Holding Pattern

What keeps people in your world between selling events:
- Email newsletter (primary)
- Your own podcast
- YouTube channel
- X/Twitter account
- Personal content (non-promotional)

**Purpose:** Warm people up slowly. Build trust. Create familiarity.

**Example:** Peter Levels posts about cooking steak in an air fryer. Not promotional — just keeping people in his world.

### Step 3: Selling Events

What converts holding pattern → buyers:
- **Live webinar/demo** (primary recommendation)
- **Email campaign** (3-4 email sequence)
- **Retargeting ads** (upload email list to Facebook, target lookalikes)
- **Personal outreach** (identify high-value emails in list, DM/call directly)

**Key insight:** If they don't convert, they go BACK into the holding pattern. Not abandoned — nurtured until next selling event.

### Step 4: Math of the Motor

Jonathan's framework:
- 5,000 new email subscribers → 200 webinar attendees → 12 purchases
- This ratio holds consistently across campaigns

"When I see 5,000 more people joined the newsletter, I can mentally say that means another 200 will turn up to the next webinar and 12 will buy something."

## CEO Role Redefined

### The Misconception
Most AI entrepreneurs think their job is:
- Building cool products
- Optimizing processes with AI
- Setting up automations and systems

### The Reality
Your actual job is:
- **Promoting your business** (50%+ of time)
- Getting traffic
- Running selling events
- Making deals

**Evidence:** Sam Altman, Dario (Anthropic CEO), Peter Levels, Jason Fried — they're all famous because they promote constantly. CEO of Anthropic at Davos = pre-pitch to enterprise buyers. Every podcast appearance = traffic generation.

### The Procrastination Trap
"These can be procrastination machines that you're basically building for yourself."

Signs you're stuck in the trap:
- Spent 4-5 days building cool systems but not making more money
- Over-optimizing before making any revenue
- Setting up 1,000 skills/automations before building one thing
- "Measure twice, cut once" mentality

**The play:** Less prep, more action. Go straight into real projects.

## AI Use Cases in the Framework

### Traffic Phase
- **Podcast prep:** Voice dump ideas → Claude → ADHD-friendly scannable notes
- **Visual content:** Claude → infographic/blueprint HTML → vibe code in Claude Code → deploy to Vercel
- **Research:** Claude project researches podcast host (YouTube, X, past episodes) → research doc saved for future use

### Holding Pattern Phase
- **Personal content:** Not really AI's role — keep it human and authentic

### Selling Events Phase
- **Lead magnets:** Podcast transcript + Claude → 3 lead magnet concepts in minutes
  - Example outputs from transcript: "The Promoter Blueprint 1-Pager," "50 Prompts for the Promoter CEO," "The Cave Dweller Audit"
- **Email campaigns:** Marketing expert Claude project with 17,000+ lines of studied email examples → new campaign copy
- **Webinar scripts:** "Ask user question" mode in Claude Code → 30-minute grilling session → high-quality webinar content
- **Landing pages:** Claude Code → campaign page → GitHub → Vercel

---

## Jonathan's Actual Workflow

### For Podcast Appearances
1. Record 15-minute voice brain dump on phone
2. Drop transcript into Claude project (marketing assistant)
3. Claude turns it into scannable ADHD-friendly notes + HTML reference sheet
4. Claude researches the podcast/host (YouTube, X analysis) → separate research doc saved
5. Claude builds visual blueprint (HTML) → download file
6. Move to Claude Code with CLAUDE.md context file
7. Claude Code refines and deploys to Vercel
8. **Total time: ~1 hour**

### For Email/Webinar Campaigns
1. Open marketing expert Claude project (not Claude Code)
2. Has 17,766-line doc of studied marketing emails (competitor/best-in-class)
3. Says "I just finished podcast X. Create 3 lead magnet ideas based on this topic"
4. Adds CLAUDE.md context file from podcast project for richer output
5. Selects best concept → moves to Claude Code to build landing page
6. **Total time: half a day** (was 2-3 days before)

### Pro Tip: Claude vs Claude Code
- **Claude (interface):** Marketing ideation, copywriting, strategy, research
- **Claude Code:** Building deliverables (landing pages, tools, campaigns)
- Switch to Claude Code when you have something to actually build
- Use "ask user question" mode for deep strategy work (30-min grilling sessions)
- Create CLAUDE.md files to carry context between sessions

### Pro Tip: WhisperFlow
- Uses WhisperFlow for voice-to-text prompting
- "All my prompts are done by WhisperFlow — I'm talking to Claude as well"
- Enables deeper, more natural prompts (can't write this level of detail easily)

## The Abundance Mindset (vs Efficiency Mindset)

"I don't think being efficient right now is the play. The play is scaling up like crazy."

**Wrong approach:** Use AI to do the same amount of work more efficiently (solo)

**Right approach:** Keep the team, add AI, do 5x more
- 5 campaigns/month instead of 1
- Many more Facebook ad variations (update weekly vs every 6 weeks)
- Triple effective team output

**Quote:** "I basically feel like you can clone yourself and just do more shit."

---

## Warning: Don't Build Everything Custom

Story: Laura (co-founder) spent 3 days building a custom proposal builder. Asked Claude "would it be easier to use an off-the-shelf solution?" Claude identified an existing tool they could have used from day one.

**Lesson:** Before building anything custom, ask Claude: "Is there an off-the-shelf solution for this?"

## Relevance to Our System

### Direct Applications for LocalCatalyst.ai

**Traffic Generation:**
- Archer should track which channels are generating traffic for agency
- Blog content (sandbags.info model → apply to agency content)
- Podcast appearances as CEO (Cody should be appearing on local business podcasts)

**Holding Pattern:**
- Agency newsletter (does it exist? should be primary holding pattern)
- LinkedIn content for local business owner ICP
- This is where Scribe can produce consistent content

**Selling Events:**
- Webinars targeting local business owners ($250-500K per event potential at scale)
- Email campaigns (Scribe-generated sequences)
- Direct outreach from email list (Scout identifying high-value leads)
- Mozi can design the webinar offer/pricing using Hormozi framework

**AI Workflow Adoption:**
- Scribe = marketing expert Claude project for content
- Scribe should maintain 17K-line knowledge base of best marketing emails
- WhisperFlow equivalent for Cody → voice prompts → faster campaign creation

### For the Revenue Engine

Jonathan's framework validates our planned prospecting pipeline:
```
Scout (traffic research) → 
Scribe (content/holding pattern) → 
Herald/Scribe (webinar/email selling events) → 
Mozi (offer design) → 
Lookout (tracking conversions)
```

### Selling Event Automation
- **Webinar landing pages:** Scribe + Builder (< half a day to create)
- **Email sequences:** Scribe with marketing knowledge base (3-4 email campaigns)
- **Lead magnets:** Scribe auto-generates from any content/podcast transcript
- **Retargeting:** Blitz uploads email list to Meta, runs lookalike campaigns

### Key Numbers to Target
- 5,000 email subscribers → 200 webinar signups → 12 buyers
- Apply this to LocalCatalyst.ai newsletter growth as proxy for revenue potential
- 1,000 subscribers = 40 webinar attendees = 2-3 buyers (at agency pricing = $5K-10K)

## Key Quotes

> "Your job as CEO is not your job description is 'I'm going to use AI tools and get really good at them.' Your job is not 'I'm going to build cool little products.' If you are not able to promote those things, no one's going to use them."

> "The most successful people in the AI space spend at least 50% of their job promoting their businesses."

> "These AI tools, if used wrong, can be procrastination machines that you're basically building for yourself."

> "I don't think being efficient right now is the play. The play is scaling up like crazy."

> "I basically feel like you can clone yourself and just do more shit."

> "If you just accept that your role as CEO is promoter — don't be embarrassed about it. It is literally the job of a CEO."
