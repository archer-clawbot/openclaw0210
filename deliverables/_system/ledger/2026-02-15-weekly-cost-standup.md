## 🎯 COST OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. **Monitor Opus Usage (High-Impact)**
- **Current**: $142.50/week (35% of spend)
- **Opportunity**: Archer & Silas use Opus for complex work; can we batch tasks or use Sonnet for lower-complexity work?
- **Potential savings**: $15-25/week (10-15% reduction)
- **Implementation**: Coordinate with Archer to identify Sonnet-eligible tasks by mid-week
- **Difficulty**: Medium | **Timeline**: Week 2

### 2. **BrightLocal Utilization (Medium-Impact)**
- **Current**: $28.40/week allocation
- **Opportunity**: Usage pattern unclear; may be over-allocated
- **Potential savings**: $5-10/week if downgraded
- **Implementation**: Check platform activity logs; downgrade if <40% used
- **Difficulty**: Low | **Timeline**: Week 2

### 3. **Hosting Tier Evaluation (Low-Impact)**
- **Current**: $48/week baseline
- **Opportunity**: Initial Cloudways allocation may be conservative for current load
- **Potential savings**: $8-12/week with better sizing
- **Implementation**: Monitor server load; request Silas to right-size
- **Difficulty**: Low | **Timeline**: Week 3

### 4. **Tool Consolidation (Future)**
- **Current**: BrightLocal + SEMrush (partial)
- **Opportunity**: Evaluate single platform consolidation by month-end
- **Potential savings**: $20-30/month if consolidated
- **Difficulty**: High | **Timeline**: March review
