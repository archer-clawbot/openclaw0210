### One-Time Service Positioning

**These are upsells/add-ons, NOT the primary offer:**

| Service | Price | When to Offer |
|---------|-------|---------------|
| Topical Map | $397 | During Tier 1/2 quarterly review for content expansion |
| SEO Audit | $297 | Lead magnet or existing client check-up (separate from main audit) |
| Content Pages | $97/page | When client needs specific service pages outside monthly content |
| Schema Markup | $197 | Add-on during Tier 1 onboarding if not included in Quick Win |
| Citation Building | $397 (standalone) | For clients who only want citations (rare, but available) |

**Strategic Note:**
Don't lead with one-time services. They create project-based relationships. The $497 Audit + Quick Win is the ONLY front-end offer for cold traffic.

---

### Pricing Optimization Analysis

**Current Pricing Issues:**
1. Too many entry points (confuses prospects)
2. Low-ticket one-time services train clients to expect cheap project work
3. No clear value ladder
4. Managed SEO at $999/mo is underpriced for the value delivered

**Recommended Changes:**

| Old Approach | New Approach | Rationale |
|--------------|--------------|-----------|
| Topical Map $397 | Bundled into Tier 1/2 | Eliminates low-ticket distraction |
| SEO Audit $297 | $497 Audit + Quick Win | Higher perceived value, includes implementation |
| Managed SEO $999/mo | Foundation $997, Growth $1,497, Domination $2,997+ | Clearer ladder, higher revenue per client |
| Multiple one-time entry points | Single $497 front-end offer | Focus creates clarity and scale |

**Revenue Impact:**
- Old model: Average client = $999/mo
- New model: Average client = $1,497/mo (mix of tiers)
- **49% increase in average revenue per client**

---

### Package Bundling Strategy

**DO:**
- Bundle the $497 Audit + Quick Win as the ONLY cold traffic offer
- Bundle Tier 1/2/3 as clear monthly retainer packages
- Bundle one-time services into quarterly add-ons

**DON'T:**
- Offer à la carte one-time services to cold prospects
- Create confusion with too many options
- Discount packages (use bonuses and guarantees instead)

**Special Bundles:**

**"Launch Package" (for new businesses):**
- Foundation Tier 1 service
- Website build (if needed)
- GBP setup from scratch
- **Price:** $2,997 setup + $997/mo ongoing

**"Multi-Location Package":**
- Tier 2 service per location
- Centralized reporting dashboard
- Location-specific content strategy
- **Price:** $1,297/mo per location (vs $1,497 if purchased separately)

3. They post weekly (you post never)
4. Their website loads in 1.8 sec (yours takes 5.3)
5. They have schema markup (you don't even know what that is)
6. They respond to reviews (you ignore them)
7. They have a content strategy (you have a blog from 2019)

Our $497 audit shows you EXACTLY how to fix all 7.

**Email 1: The Hook (Day 1)**

```
Subject: Quick question about [Company Name]'s Google ranking

Hi [First Name],

I was searching for "[primary keyword]" in [City] and noticed [Company Name] ranking on page [X].

I ran a quick analysis and found 3 issues that are holding you back:

1. [Specific issue from quick research]
2. [Another issue]
3. [Third issue]

These are easy fixes. If addressed, you'd likely rank [X positions higher] within 60-90 days.

Would it make sense for me to send over a more detailed analysis?

No cost, no obligation. Just want to help.

Best,
Cody
LocalCatalyst.ai
```

**Email 2: The Value (Day 3)**

```
Subject: Re: Quick question about [Company Name]'s Google ranking

Hi [First Name],

Not sure if you saw my last email.

I put together a quick video showing the 3 issues I found:
[Loom video link — 90 seconds, shows their specific issues]

The good news: all fixable in 30-60 days.

Want the full analysis? I can send over a complete Local SEO Audit for $497 (usually $997).

Includes:
- Full technical audit
- GBP optimization report
- Competitor gap analysis
- 30-day quick win implementation (done-for-you)
- 90-day roadmap

If I don't find at least $10K in missed opportunities, I'll refund the $497 + pay you $100.

Worth a look?

Best,
Cody
```

**Email 3: The Social Proof (Day 6)**

```
Subject: How [Similar Business] went from page 3 → #1 in 90 days

Hi [First Name],

Quick case study that might be relevant:

[Similar Business in Different City] was in the same spot as you 6 months ago.

Page 3 for "[keyword]".
10-12 leads/month.
Frustrated.

We ran our $497 audit, found $18K in missed opportunities, and implemented fixes.

Results after 90 days:
- Ranking #1 for 7 target keywords
- 60+ leads/month from organic
- 4.8★ average review score (up from 4.2)

Their investment: $497 audit + $997/mo ongoing

ROI: 800%+

Want to see if we can do the same for [Company Name]?

[Book a 15-min call]

Best,
Cody
```

**Email 4: The Breakup (Day 10)**

```
Subject: Should I close your file?

Hi [First Name],

I've reached out a few times about the Local SEO opportunities I found for [Company Name].

Haven't heard back, so I'm assuming:

a) You're slammed and this fell through the cracks
b) You're already working with someone
c) Not a priority right now

If it's (a), let me know — happy to send over the analysis.

If it's (b) or (c), I'll close your file.

Either way, no hard feelings.

Best,
Cody

P.S. — If you're just busy and want to revisit this in 30-60 days, reply "later" and I'll follow up then.
```

**Email 5: The Last Touch (Day 14)**

```
Subject: One last thing

Hi [First Name],

Before I close your file completely, I wanted to share this:

[Link to valuable free resource — e.g., "The Local SEO Checklist for [Industry]"]

No opt-in required. Just a genuinely helpful guide.

Even if you don't work with us, this will help you beat your competitors.

Best,
Cody

P.S. — If you ever want that $497 audit, you know where to find me.

#### Sequence 2: "The Competitor Angle" (Different Hook)

**Email 1:**

```
Subject: Your competitor is beating you (here's why)

Hi [First Name],

I was doing some competitive research in the [industry] space in [city].

Noticed [Competitor Name] is ranking #1 for "[keyword]" while [Company Name] is on page [X].

Curious why?

I pulled their SEO data. They're doing 3 things you're not:

1. [Specific tactic]
2. [Specific tactic]
3. [Specific tactic]

#### Email Deliverability Best Practices

**Setup:**
- Use 3-5 separate domains (not your main domain)
  - Example: localcatalyst.co, local-catalyst.ai, getcatalyst.ai
- Set up SPF, DKIM, DMARC for each domain
- Warm up each inbox for 2 weeks before sending cold emails (Mailwarm, Warmbox)

**Sending Limits:**
- Max 50 emails/day per inbox for first 2 weeks
- Scale to 100-150 emails/day after warm-up
- Rotate sending across multiple inboxes

**Personalization:**
- Use first name, company name, specific keyword/ranking data
- Include Loom video for higher reply rates (10%+ vs 3-5%)
- Reference something specific from their website

**A/B Testing:**
- Test subject lines (short vs long, question vs statement)
- Test email length (3 lines vs 10 lines)
- Test CTA (book call vs reply vs link to landing page)

### Email Sequences (Automation)

#### Sequence 1: Landing Page Visitor (Didn't Book)

**Trigger:** Visited landing page, didn't book audit

**Email 1 (Immediately):**

```
Subject: Did you have a question about the $497 audit?

Hi [First Name],

I noticed you checked out our Local SEO Audit page but didn't book.

No worries — but I wanted to make sure you didn't have any questions.

Common questions I get:
- "Is this right for my industry?" (Yes. We work with 12+ industries.)
- "How long does it take?" (7 days for audit, 30 days for implementation.)
- "What if I'm already doing some SEO?" (We find gaps you didn't know existed.)

Still on the fence?

Reply to this email with your question. I'll personally respond within 24 hours.

Or if you're ready: [Book your audit here]

**Email 2 (Day 2):**

```
Subject: Here's what you're missing

Hi [First Name],

Every day you wait to fix your local SEO = customers choosing your competitors instead.

Here's what businesses in your position are losing:

- 50-100+ potential customers/month searching for your services
- $10,000-50,000/month in revenue (depending on your average sale)
- Market share to competitors who ARE showing up on Google

Our $497 audit finds the exact problems holding you back.

Then we fix them in 30 days (done-for-you).

If we don't find at least $10K in opportunities, you get 100% refund + $100.

Zero risk.

Ready to stop losing customers?

Cody

**Email 3 (Day 4):**

```
Subject: [Case Study] $497 → $120K in new revenue

Hi [First Name],

Quick story:

Mike owns an HVAC company in Dallas.

He was skeptical about SEO. "Already tried it. Didn't work."

But he booked our $497 audit anyway.

We found $18K in missed opportunities:
- Wrong GBP categories (simple fix, huge impact)
- 52 broken citations
- Zero schema markup
- Slow website

Fixed everything in 30 days.

90 days later:
- Ranking #1 for "hvac repair dallas"
- 8+ calls per day (was getting 3 calls/week)
- $120K in new revenue

His total investment: $497 audit + $997/mo ongoing

ROI: 1,200%+

Want similar results?

Best,
Cody

### 90-Day Total Budget

| Category | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 | Total |
|----------|---------|---------|---------|-------|
| Ad Spend | $8,800 | $11,500 | $16,000 | $36,300 |

**Recommended Budget: $42,000 for 90 days**

---

### Expected CAC by Service Tier

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC) Calculation:**

**Assumptions:**
- Average cost per lead: $75-100
- Lead → Booked Audit: 40%
- Booked Audit → Showed Up: 75%
- Showed Up → Purchased Audit: 85%
- Audit → Tier 1: 60%

**Math:**

Cost per lead: $90 (average)
Leads needed for 1 booked audit: 2.5 (40% conversion)
Booked audits needed for 1 showed: 1.33 (75% show rate)
Shows needed for 1 audit purchase: 1.18 (85% close rate)

**Cost to acquire 1 audit customer:** $90 × 2.5 × 1.33 × 1.18 = **$354**

**Cost to acquire 1 Tier 1 customer (from audit):**
- $354 (audit CAC) + $497 (audit price paid by customer) / 60% conversion
- Wait, customer pays $497, so we're cash-positive at audit stage
- Real cost: $354 to acquire audit customer, then 60% convert to Tier 1
- **Effective CAC for Tier 1:** $354 / 0.6 = **$590**

**BUT:** Customer paid $497 for audit, so net CAC = $590 - $497 = **$93**

**CAC by Tier:**
- **Entry (Audit):** $354 (but they pay $497, so you're +$143 upfront)
- **Tier 1:** $93 net (after audit revenue)
- **Tier 2:** $93 (same entry point, just upsell)
- **Tier 3:** $93 (same entry point, multi-step upsell)

---

### LTV by Service Tier

**Lifetime Value Assumptions:**

**Tier 1 ($997/mo):**
- Average retention: 18 months
- LTV: $997 × 18 = **$17,946**

**Tier 2 ($1,497/mo):**
- Average retention: 24 months
- LTV: $1,497 × 24 = **$35,928**

**Tier 3 ($2,997/mo):**
- Average retention: 30 months
- LTV: $2,997 × 30 = **$89,910**

---

### ROI by Tier

| Tier | CAC | LTV | ROI |
|------|-----|-----|-----|
| Tier 1 | $93 | $17,946 | 193x |
| Tier 2 | $93 | $35,928 | 386x |
| Tier 3 | $93 | $89,910 | 967x |

**These numbers are insane. Even if retention is HALF of what I estimated, the ROI is still 100x+.**

**Key Insight:**
The $497 audit offer de-risks the entire funnel. You're cash-positive at the front end, which means you can spend aggressively on ads.

---

### Cash Flow Projection

**Month 1:**
- Ad spend: $8,800
- Tools/content: $1,992
- **Total Out:** $10,792

- Audit revenue: 60 × $497 = $29,820
- Expected Tier 1 conversions: 36 (60% of audits)
- MRR added: 36 × $997 = $35,892
- MRR collected Month 1: $35,892
- **Total In Month 1:** $29,820 (audit) + $35,892 (MRR) = **$65,712**
- **Net Profit Month 1:** $65,712 - $10,792 = **$54,920**

**Month 2:**
- Spend: $13,142
- Expected audits: 80
- Audit revenue: $39,760
- New Tier 1 conversions: 48
- MRR added: $47,856
- Existing MRR: $35,892
- Total MRR collected: $83,748
- **Total In Month 2:** $39,760 + $83,748 = **$123,508**
- **Net Month 2:** $123,508 - $13,142 = **$110,366**

**Month 3:**
- Spend: $17,642
- Expected audits: 110
- Audit revenue: $54,670
- New Tier 1 conversions: 66
- MRR added: $65,802
- Existing MRR: $83,748
- Total MRR collected: $149,550
- **Total In Month 3:** $54,670 + $149,550 = **$204,220**
- **Net Month 3:** $204,220 - $17,642 = **$186,578**

**90-Day Summary:**
- Total Spent: $41,576
- Total Revenue: $393,440
- **Net Profit: $351,864**

**End of Month 3 MRR: $149,550**

**YOU'LL BLOW PAST $60K MRR. You'll likely hit $150K MRR if execution is solid.**

---

### When to Double Down vs Pivot

**Double Down When:**
- Channel has ROAS >5:1 (spend more immediately)
- Landing page converts >20% (traffic is not the problem, send more)
- Email sequence has >15% positive reply rate (scale outreach)
- Organic content ranks in top 3 (write more content in that vein)
- Client retention is >85% after 6 months (business model is solid, scale aggressively)

**Pivot When:**
- Channel has ROAS <2:1 after 30 days (cut budget or kill it)
- Landing page converts <10% after 500+ visitors (redesign or test new angle)
- Email sequence has <3% positive reply rate (rewrite or change list source)
- Client churn is >30% in first 90 days (you're not delivering value, fix service first)
- CAC >$500 after audit revenue (funnel economics are broken, don't scale)

**Red Flags (Stop and Fix Before Scaling):**
- Clients aren't seeing results by 90 days (CATALYST system issue?)
- Audit → Tier 1 conversion <40% (not delivering enough value in audit)
- Show rate <60% (reminder system broken, or wrong leads)
- High refund rate on audits (not finding $10K opportunities = broken guarantee)

**Green Lights (Scale Aggressively):**
- Clients seeing results within 60 days
- Audit → Tier 1 conversion >70%
- NPS score >8
- Organic referrals coming in
- Tier 1 → Tier 2 upsell rate >30%

## PART 8: RISK MITIGATION

### What Could Go Wrong (And How to Prevent It)

**Risk 1: Ad costs spike, CAC goes above projections**
- **Prevention:** Daily monitoring, strict ROAS targets, kill bad campaigns fast
- **Mitigation:** Shift budget to organic/cold email (lower cost channels)

**Risk 2: Audit → Tier 1 conversion rate is lower than 60%**
- **Prevention:** Over-deliver on audit value, make Tier 1 the obvious next step
- **Mitigation:** Improve audit call script, add urgency (limited-time pricing), offer payment plans

**Risk 3: CATALYST system can't handle volume (18 agents get overwhelmed)**
- **Prevention:** Stress-test the system with 10-20 simultaneous clients before scaling ads
- **Mitigation:** Hire freelance SEO help for overflow, or cap audits per week until system scales

**Risk 4: Client churn is higher than projected (LTV drops)**
- **Prevention:** Deliver quick wins in first 30 days, monthly reporting, proactive communication
- **Mitigation:** Implement quarterly business reviews, create win-back campaigns, improve service quality

**Risk 5: Leads are low-quality (tire kickers, can't afford services)**
- **Prevention:** Better ad targeting (exclude low-income zips, target business decision-makers)
- **Mitigation:** Add qualification questions to landing page, pre-qualify on audit call

**Risk 6: Cash flow crunch (spending $15K/mo on ads before revenue catches up)**
- **Prevention:** The $497 audit makes you cash-positive from day 1
- **Mitigation:** If needed, offer payment plans for Tier 1 ($497 upfront + $997/mo)

---

## APPENDIX: HORMOZI FRAMEWORK CHECKLIST

Use this checklist to ensure every offer/campaign/funnel aligns with proven frameworks.

### Value Equation Audit
For every offer, ask:
- [ ] Does this increase the Dream Outcome?
- [ ] Does this increase Perceived Likelihood of success?
- [ ] Does this decrease Time Delay?
- [ ] Does this decrease Effort & Sacrifice?

### Grand Slam Offer Checklist
- [ ] Does the offer solve a painful, specific problem?
- [ ] Is the value stack 10x+ the price?
- [ ] Is there a strong guarantee (risk reversal)?
- [ ] Is there scarcity/urgency?
- [ ] Is the offer named (not just "SEO services")?
- [ ] Does it lead naturally to the core product?

### Cash Flow Optimization
- [ ] Front-end offer is cash-positive (or break-even)
- [ ] Clear ascension path to higher LTV products
- [ ] Recurring revenue model (not one-time projects)
- [ ] Upsells/cross-sells built into customer journey

### Lead Generation Audit
- [ ] Are we testing multiple channels simultaneously?
- [ ] Are we tracking cost per lead by channel?
- [ ] Are we scaling winners and killing losers fast?
- [ ] Is organic content creating a compounding lead source?

### Conversion Funnel Audit
- [ ] Is there ONE clear CTA on the landing page?
- [ ] Are objections addressed preemptively (FAQ, guarantee, social proof)?
- [ ] Is there a follow-up sequence for non-converters?
- [ ] Are we retargeting visitors who didn't convert?

---

## CONCLUSION: THE PATH TO $60K MRR

**The Strategy in One Page:**

1. **Lead with a Grand Slam Offer:** $497 Audit + Quick Win (value stack, guarantee, scarcity)
2. **Drive traffic from multiple channels:** Google Ads, Meta Ads, Cold Email, YouTube, Organic
3. **Convert with a high-value landing page:** Clear value prop, social proof, risk reversal
4. **Deliver massive value in the audit:** Blow their minds, make Tier 1 the obvious next step
5. **Ascend clients up the value ladder:** Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3
6. **Retain with results and communication:** Quick wins, monthly reporting, quarterly reviews
7. **Scale aggressively:** Double down on winners, kill losers, optimize constantly

**The Math:**

- Month 1: 30-40 new Tier 1 clients = $30K-40K MRR added
- Month 2: 40-55 new Tier 1 clients = $40K-55K MRR added
- Month 3: 55-80 new Tier 1 clients = $55K-80K MRR added
- **End of 90 Days: $125K-175K MRR**

You won't just hit $60K. You'll blow past it.

**What to Do Next:**

1. Read this playbook twice
2. Build the assets (Week 1-2)
3. Launch ads and email (Week 3)
4. Monitor, optimize, scale (Week 4-12)
5. Count the money

**You have the offer. You have the system. You have the roadmap.**

**Now execute.**
