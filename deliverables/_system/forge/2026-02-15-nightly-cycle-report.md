# Forge Nightly Cycle Report
**Date:** Sunday, February 15, 2026
**Runtime:** 02:05 AM - 02:45 AM CST
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

First fully successful nightly cycle since Forge deployment. The critical Convex dispatcher issue from Feb 11-12 has been resolved by the operator. Fleet is healthy with 95% reduction in session errors. Two auto-patches applied to improve error handling and cost monitoring.

---

## Phase 1: Harvest Summary

**Data Sources Scanned:**
- Dispatcher log: `~/.openclaw/cron/dispatcher.log` (300 lines)
- Sentinel health report: `2026-02-15-nightly-health-report.md`
- Circuit breaker state: `breaker-state.json` (CLOSED)
- Session list: 12 active sessions (24h window)
- Cost data: $31.75 total (9 agents active)

**Key Findings:**
- Dispatcher healthy — polling 2 clients every 2 min
- Feb 14 dispatch activity: 11+ tasks dispatched, 6+ completed for localcatalyst
- Session errors: 13 (down from 254 on Feb 12)
- All 18 bots online

## Phase 2: Diagnosis Summary

| Issue | Code | Score | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| Convex backend | P-INFRA | N/A | ✅ RESOLVED |
| Main cost spike | P-COST | 12 | Legitimate (operator request) |
| Mozi API auth | P-TOOL | 8 | Needs investigation |
| Tool errors (13) | P-TOOL | 6 | Monitoring only |

---

## Phase 3: Prescriptions

### Rx-1: Mozi API Error Handling
- **Type:** PROMPT-PATCH
- **Risk:** 2/5
- **Auto-apply:** YES
- **Rationale:** Mozi retried indefinitely on 401 — needs stop + escalate protocol

### Rx-2: Cost Anomaly Detection
- **Type:** PROMPT-PATCH
- **Risk:** 1/5
- **Auto-apply:** YES
- **Rationale:** No visibility into disproportionate agent spend

### Rx-3: Mozi API Key Investigation
- **Type:** CONFIG-FIX
- **Risk:** 3/5
- **Auto-apply:** NO (touches secrets)
- **Rationale:** Requires operator to verify/regenerate Anthropic API key

---

## Phase 4: Changes Applied

### Auto-Applied (2)

**1. mozi/AGENTS.md**
- Added: API Error Handling section (lines 92-112)
- Content: Protocol for 401/403 errors — stop retry, escalate, mark blocked
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-15/mozi__AGENTS.md`
- Rollback: `cp ~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-15/mozi__AGENTS.md ~/.openclaw/mozi/AGENTS.md`

**2. sentinel/AGENTS.md**
- Added: Check 9: Cost Anomaly Detection
- Content: Monitors daily fleet cost, alerts if any agent >50% or total >$50
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-15/sentinel__AGENTS.md`
- Rollback: `cp ~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-15/sentinel__AGENTS.md ~/.openclaw/sentinel/AGENTS.md`

### Pending Approval (1)

**Mozi API Key Investigation**
- Error: 401 "invalid x-api-key" from Anthropic
- Action required: Verify API credentials in openclaw.json or environment
- If expired: Regenerate at console.anthropic.com

### Health Metrics
| Metric | Feb 12 | Feb 15 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Session Errors | 254 | 13 | ⬇️ 95% |
| Dispatcher Status | FAILED | HEALTHY | ✅ |
| Tasks Dispatched | 0 | 11+ | ✅ |
| Bots Online | 18/18 | 18/18 | — |
| Circuit Breaker | CLOSED | CLOSED | — |

## Tracked Issues (No Action)

1. **Main cost spike ($22.27)** — Legitimate: operator requested comprehensive implementation spec document. Not a runaway loop or waste.

2. **Tool errors (13)** — Down 95% from Feb 12. Transient issues across forge (2), main (9), mozi (2). No pattern suggesting systemic failure. Continue monitoring.

3. **Dispatcher zero tasks (overnight)** — Normal: task queue is empty overnight. Earlier logs confirm successful dispatch when tasks exist.

## Improvement Streak

**Night 1** 🔥

First night with:
- Working dispatcher (Convex issue resolved)
- Auto-patches applied
- Full 5-phase cycle completed

---

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled:** Monday, Feb 16, 2026 at 02:05 AM CST

**Focus areas:**
- Verify Mozi API key investigation completed
- Confirm new Sentinel Check 9 (cost anomaly) runs correctly
- Monitor session error trend
- Track cost distribution
