# Forge Nightly Cycle Report
**Date:** Monday, February 16, 2026
**Runtime:** 02:05 AM - 02:35 AM CST
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Night 2 of successful improvements. Critical finding: **TOOLS.md documentation was wrong** across 4 agent workspaces, claiming "PowerShell" when exec actually runs bash. This was the root cause of 17+ shell syntax errors in the last 24 hours. Fixed by correcting documentation in forge, workspace, main, and scout.

---

## Phase 1: Harvest Summary

**Data Sources Scanned:**
- Dispatcher log: `~/.openclaw/cron/dispatcher.log` (healthy, 0 tasks overnight)
- Sentinel health report: `2026-02-16-nightly-health-check.md` (CRITICAL: 30 errors, cost spike)
- Circuit breaker state: `breaker-state.json` (CLOSED - healthy)
- Session logs: main, forge, scout, sentinel (last 24h)
- Cost data: $18.58 total

**Key Findings:**
- 30 tool execution errors (down from 254 on Feb 12)
- main agent at 76% of daily spend (flagged by Sentinel Check 9)
- Dispatcher healthy, no tasks queued overnight

---

## Phase 2: Diagnosis Summary

| Issue | Code | Score | Root Cause |
|-------|------|-------|------------|
| Shell doc mismatch | P-PROMPT | 20 | TOOLS.md said PowerShell, exec is bash |
| Cost concentration | P-COST | 6 | Legitimate operator work |
| Tool errors (30) | P-TOOL | 6 | Shell syntax + ENOENT + 403s |

**Error Breakdown:**
- PowerShell syntax in bash: 17 errors
- File not found (ENOENT): 5 errors
- Web fetch blocked (403): 5 errors
- EISDIR (read dir as file): 2 errors
- Other: 1 error

## Phase 3: Prescriptions Applied

### Rx-1: Shell Environment Documentation Fix
- **Type:** PROMPT-PATCH
- **Risk:** 2/5 (low - documentation only)
- **Auto-apply:** YES
- **Files affected:** 4 TOOLS.md files
- **Impact:** Should eliminate 17+ errors per day

---

## Phase 4: Changes Applied

### Auto-Applied (4)

**1. forge/TOOLS.md**
- Changed: "PowerShell" → "bash (Git Bash)"
- Reversed command table (bash correct, PowerShell wrong)
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-16/forge__TOOLS.md`

**2. workspace/TOOLS.md (Archer)**
- Same fix as above
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-16/workspace__TOOLS.md`

**3. main/TOOLS.md**
- Same fix as above
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-16/main__TOOLS.md`

**4. scout/TOOLS.md**
- Same fix as above
- Backup: `~/.openclaw/forge/backups/2026-02-16/scout__TOOLS.md`

### Skipped (1)

**sentinel/TOOLS.md**
- Already had correct bash documentation
- No changes needed

## Phase 5: Metrics

### Cost Breakdown (24h)
| Agent | Cost | % of Total |
|-------|------|------------|
| main | $14.05 | 76% |
| forge | $4.06 | 22% |
| scout | $0.33 | 2% |
| sentinel | $0.14 | <1% |
| **TOTAL** | **$18.58** | 100% |

### Health Metrics
| Metric | Feb 12 | Feb 15 | Feb 16 | Trend |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|-------|
| Session Errors | 254 | 13 | 30 | ⬇️ 88% |
| Dispatcher | FAILED | HEALTHY | HEALTHY | ✅ |
| Shell Errors | ~100+ | 10 | 17 | Fixed ✅ |

## Expected Impact

With TOOLS.md corrections applied:
- **Shell syntax errors:** Should drop from ~17/day to near zero
- **Agent efficiency:** Fewer retries, faster task completion
- **Cost reduction:** Fewer wasted tokens on failed commands

---

## Pending Items (Carryover)

1. **Mozi API key** — Feb 15 issue, needs operator verification if not yet resolved
2. **Slack token missing** — Sentinel can't post to #sentinel Slack channel

---

## Improvement Streak

**Night 2** 🔥🔥

- Night 1: Convex fixed, Mozi error handling, Sentinel cost monitoring
- Night 2: Shell documentation fixed (4 files)

---

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled:** Tuesday, Feb 17, 2026 at 02:05 AM CST

**Focus areas:**
- Verify shell errors dropped after TOOLS.md fix
- Monitor cost distribution
- Check if Mozi API key was resolved
