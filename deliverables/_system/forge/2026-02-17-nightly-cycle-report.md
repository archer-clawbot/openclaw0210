# Forge Nightly Cycle Report
**Date:** Monday, February 17, 2026
**Runtime:** 02:05 AM - 02:45 AM CST
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

---

## Executive Summary

Third consecutive stable night. No new patches required — previous fixes from Feb 16 (shell documentation corrections) are holding. Two persistent issues tracked: Mozi API key (night 3, needs operator action) and cost concentration in main agent (flagged by Sentinel but legitimate usage).

---

## Phase 1: Harvest Summary

**Data Sources Scanned:**
- Dispatcher log: HEALTHY — polling every 2 min, 0 tasks (queue empty overnight)
- Sentinel health report: 2026-02-17 (status: CRITICAL due to cost + errors)
- Circuit breaker state: CLOSED (healthy)
- Session list: 5 sessions active in last 24h
- Cost data: $31.76 total (3 agents active)

**Key Findings:**
- Dispatcher: Polling chicagos-electrician + localcatalyst, no errors
- Session errors: 75 (up from 30 — forge: 26, main: 49)
- Cost concentration: main at 84% ($26.66/$31.76)
- Mozi: Still receiving 401 auth errors (third night)

## Phase 2: Diagnosis Summary

| Issue | Code | Score | Status |
|-------|------|-------|--------|
| Main cost concentration | P-COST | 6 | Flagged but legitimate |
| Mozi API auth | P-TOOL | 4 | PERSISTENT - Night 3 |
| Session errors (75) | P-TOOL | 6 | Investigating |
| Shell documentation | P-PROMPT | N/A | ✅ RESOLVED Feb 16 |

---

## Phase 3: Prescriptions

No new prescriptions tonight. Previous fixes are holding:

1. **Shell documentation** (Feb 16) — Agents now correctly using bash commands
2. **Mozi error handling** (Feb 15) — Mozi now properly reports auth failures
3. **Sentinel cost monitoring** (Feb 15) — Check 9 working correctly

---

## Phase 4: Changes Applied

**None.** System is stable. No auto-patches required.

### Pending Operator Action (ESCALATING)

**Mozi API Key — Night 3**
- Error: 401 invalid x-api-key from Anthropic
- First seen: Feb 15, 2026
- Impact: Mozi cannot process any tasks
- Action: Regenerate API key, update config
- Priority: MEDIUM (Mozi is used for business strategy tasks)

## Phase 5: Metrics

### Cost Breakdown (24h)
| Agent | Cost | % of Total |
|-------|------|-----------:|
| main | $26.66 | 84.0% |
| forge | $4.96 | 15.6% |
| sentinel | $0.14 | 0.4% |
| **TOTAL** | **$31.76** | 100% |

### Health Metrics
| Metric | Feb 16 | Feb 17 | Change |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Session Errors | 30 | 75 | ↑ 150% |
| Dispatcher Status | HEALTHY | HEALTHY | — |
| Tasks Dispatched | 0 | 0 | — |
| Bots Online | 18/18 | 18/18 | — |
| Circuit Breaker | CLOSED | CLOSED | — |

**Session error increase:** Need to investigate. Sentinel reports 75 errors (forge: 26, main: 49). May be transient tool execution issues or related to specific tasks.

---

## Tracked Issues

1. **Mozi API auth (Night 3)** — Operator action required to regenerate key

2. **Session errors (75)** — Increased from 30. Patterns unclear. Monitoring.

3. **Cost concentration** — main at 84%. Legitimate usage (operator requests). Sentinel correctly flagging per Check 9.

4. **Slack token** — Still missing. Low priority — Telegram delivery working.

---

## Improvement Streak

**Night 3** 🔥🔥🔥

Three consecutive nights with:
- Stable operations
- No critical failures
- Dispatcher healthy
- All bots online

Previous improvements compounding:
- Feb 11-12: Convex issue (RESOLVED Feb 14)
- Feb 15: Mozi error handling + Sentinel cost monitoring added
- Feb 16: Shell documentation corrected across fleet

---

## Next Cycle

**Scheduled:** Tuesday, Feb 18, 2026 at 02:05 AM CST

**Focus areas:**
- Track session error trend (75 → ?)
- Verify if operator addressed Mozi API key
- Continue monitoring cost distribution
- Check if shell fixes reduced error rate
