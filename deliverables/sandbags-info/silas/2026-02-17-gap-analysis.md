### ⚠️ RESTRUCTURED — Written but Needs New URL + Content Update (1 page)

| File | Current URL | Target URL | Action Required |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| `2026-02-17-military-sandbags.md` | `/military-sandbags/` | `/military-spec-sandbags/` | Move from Pillar 4 to Pillar 3. Refocus on MIL-B-52472C specs, material standards, not just commercial application. Add military procurement angle. Rename file to `military-spec-sandbags.md`. 4K–6.5K/mo volume. |

---

### 🔀 MERGED — Content Written, but URL Superseded (3 pages)

These files exist in scribe but their standalone URLs were eliminated in the updated map. The content should be folded into the target page — NOT published as separate pages.

| File | Written URL | Target Page | Action |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| `2026-02-17-sandbag-filling-stations.md` | `/sandbag-filling-stations/` | `/how-to-fill-sandbags/` | Fold content as a section. `/how-to-fill-sandbags/` is already written — Scribe should update it to include a "DIY Filling Station Setup" section. |
| `2026-02-17-sandbag-materials.md` | `/sandbag-materials/` | `/types-of-sandbags/` | Fold content as a subsection. `/types-of-sandbags/` is already written — add materials comparison section to avoid cannibalization. |
| `2026-02-16-sandbag-shelf-life.md` | `/sandbag-shelf-life/` | `/how-long-do-sandbags-last/` | Target page NOT YET WRITTEN. Use this content as the foundation. Lifespan-outdoor content should also be folded in. |

---

### 🗑️ REMOVED — Cut Entirely from Updated Map (2 pages)

Do not publish these. Archive or delete from queue.

| File | URL | Reason for Removal |
|------|-----|---------------------|
| `2026-02-17-sandbags-for-dust-control.md` | `/sandbags-for-dust-control/` | Near-zero search volume; no topical authority contribution; thin content risk |
| `2026-02-17-sandbags-for-tree-staking.md` | `/sandbags-for-tree-staking/` | Near-zero search volume; no viable keyword cluster; topical orphan |

## PART 2: GAP ANALYSIS — Pages in Updated Map Not Yet Written

**Total missing: 51 pages across Phase 1 (11), Phase 2 (29), Phase 3 (11)**

---

### ❌ PHASE 1 GAPS — WRITE IMMEDIATELY (11 pages)

These are either critical-path for authority launch or pre-launch requirements. Nothing should go live on sandbags.info without the E-E-A-T pages. The content gaps here represent the highest-volume unwritten opportunities.

#### Pre-Launch Requirements (E-E-A-T Infrastructure)
*Must exist before ANY content page goes live — not traffic pages, but Google trust infrastructure*

| # | URL | Purpose | Notes |
|---|-----|---------|-------|
| P1-A | `/about/` | Who runs the site; credentials; editorial standards | Named individual + credentials required; link to editorial policy |
| P1-B | `/editorial-policy/` | Research, writing, and review standards | YMYL-adjacent content requires documented process |
| P1-C | `/contact/` | Trust signal + lead gen form | Physical/mailing address recommended |

#### Highest-Volume Content Gaps (Phase 1)

| # | URL | Volume | Type | Priority Rationale |
|---|-----|--------|------|--------------------|
| P1-1 | `/bulk-sandbags/` | 10K–18K/mo | Article | **Highest-volume unwritten page in the entire architecture. B2B + consumer pallet/truckload intent.** |
| P1-2 | `/best-sandbags-for-flooding/` | 5K–8K/mo | Article + FAQPage | Core commercial page; high buyer intent; completes Pillar 5 Phase 1 cluster |
| P1-3 | `/sandbag-delivery-services/` | 5K–9K/mo | Article + LocalBusiness | Primary lead gen page; must receive internal links from every flood and buying article |
| P1-4 | `/diy-sandbag-wall/` | 2K–3.5K/mo | HowTo + FAQPage | New page; Phase 1 per updated map; step-by-step with images; Featured Snippet target |
| P1-5 | `/sandbag-filling-service/` | Transactional | Service page | Direct lead gen; bulk orders filled and delivered CTA; GA4 conversion goal |

#### Tools Cluster Gaps (Phase 1)

| # | URL | Volume | Priority Rationale |
|---|-----|--------|--------------------|
| P1-6 | `/tools/` | Hub page | Landing page for all calculators; internal link magnet; every how-many/how-much page links here |
| P1-7 | `/sandbag-weight-calculator/` | 2K–3.5K/mo | Phase 1 tool; supports buying decision; high engagement |
| P1-8 | `/sandbag-wall-calculator/` | 1.5K–3K/mo | Phase 1 tool; DIY intent; links from stacking + barrier content |

---

### ❌ PHASE 2 GAPS — EXPANSION (29 pages)

All Phase 2 content should begin production immediately after Phase 1 is complete. Organize into three sprints: (A) new cluster pages, (B) buying guide completion, (C) state guides.

| P2-29 | `/expert-contributors/` | E-E-A-T | Phase 2 | Author bios; credential display; publish with first by-lined content |

---

### ❌ PHASE 3 GAPS — LONG TAIL (11 pages)

Produce only after Phase 1 and Phase 2 are complete. Low volume, niche audience, or thin content risk. Do not rush these — traffic data from Phases 1–2 should inform final prioritization.

| # | URL | Type | Phase 3 Notes |
|---|-----|------|---------------|
| P3-1 | `/polyethylene-sandbags/` | Article | Very low volume; only if poly sandbags article gains traction |
| P3-2 | `/colored-sandbags/` | Article | Very low volume; no compelling search intent cluster |
| P3-3 | `/mini-sandbags/` | Article | Fragmented intent (crafts, cornhole, barriers) — thin content risk |
| P3-4 | `/sandbags-iowa/` | State guide | Midwest river flooding; Phase 3 state |
| P3-5 | `/sandbags-missouri/` | State guide | Missouri/Mississippi River flooding |
| P3-6 | `/sandbags-kentucky/` | State guide | Appalachian + river flooding |
| P3-7 | `/sandbags-for-weighing-down/` | Blog | Vague intent; low priority |
| P3-8 | `/sandbag-innovations/` | Blog | Trend-dependent; produce only if news cycle creates demand |
| P3-9 | `/sandbag-success-stories/` | Blog | E-E-A-T builder; not a traffic driver |
| P3-10 | `/sandbag-failures/` | Blog | Interesting angle; pairs with "do sandbags work" |
| P3-11 | `/best-colored-sandbags/` | Buying guide | Very low volume; only if colored-sandbags page shows traffic |
