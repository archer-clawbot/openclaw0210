# Sandbags in Alabama: Flood Prep and Distribution Guide

Alabama sits at the intersection of multiple serious flood threats: Gulf Coast storm surge along the south, Tennessee River flooding across the north, flash flooding throughout the central hills and urban areas, and hurricane and tropical storm exposure that can drive devastating rainfall far inland. For Alabama homeowners, flood preparedness isn't a once-a-decade concern — it's an annual reality.

This guide covers where to get sandbags in Alabama, how state and county emergency management programs work, and what residents in key flood-prone areas need to know before the next event.

## Alabama's Flood Risk

### Mobile Bay and the Gulf Coast

Mobile is the most flood-vulnerable major city in Alabama, and one of the most hurricane-exposed cities in the Gulf South. Mobile Bay's funnel shape concentrates storm surge from Gulf hurricanes, with major events pushing seawater up the Bay and into the Mobile-Tensaw Delta, Dog River corridor, and low-lying coastal neighborhoods.

Alabama receives a direct or near-direct Gulf hurricane landfall roughly every 5–7 years historically, and tropical storm impacts are significantly more frequent. Even storms that make landfall in Louisiana or the Florida Panhandle regularly produce damaging flooding in Mobile and Baldwin counties through both surge and rainfall.

Coastal Alabama also faces nuisance flooding tied to king tides and seasonal high-water events, which are increasing in frequency. Areas near Bayou Sara, Fowl River, and the various tidal creek systems in Mobile County are particularly affected.

### Tennessee River System

Northern Alabama — including Madison County (Huntsville), Limestone, Morgan, and Lawrence counties — sits in the Tennessee River watershed. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) manages a system of dams and reservoirs throughout the region, providing significant flood control capacity. However, major precipitation events can still overwhelm the system.

Huntsville and the surrounding area have experienced significant flooding from multiple sources including Village Creek, Flint Creek, and other tributaries. Wheeler Lake, Wilson Lake, and Guntersville Lake — all TVA reservoirs — provide buffer capacity that reduces but does not eliminate flood risk downstream.

### Central Alabama and Flash Flooding

The hilly terrain of central Alabama — including the Birmingham metro, Montgomery, and the I-20/59 corridor — creates significant flash flood risk. Urban areas with extensive impervious surface (roads, parking lots, rooftops) concentrate runoff, overwhelming storm drainage systems during intense convective rainfall events. Birmingham's Shades Creek, Village Creek, and Cahaba River tributaries have produced serious flooding in residential and commercial areas.

Montgomery sits along the Alabama River, which drains a large watershed and can experience prolonged flooding following major rainfall events across central and northern Alabama.

## Where to Get Sandbags in Alabama

### AEMA — Alabama Emergency Management Agency

The Alabama Emergency Management Agency (AEMA) is the state's primary emergency coordination body. During declared flood emergencies, AEMA activates its State Emergency Operations Center and coordinates with county emergency management agencies to support sandbag distribution and flood response logistics.

**Contact AEMA:**
- Website: [aema.alabama.gov](https://aema.alabama.gov)
- Main line: (205) 280-2200
- For emergency updates during active events, monitor AEMA's website and official social media

AEMA supports county operations but does not typically maintain direct consumer-facing distribution sites. Contact your county emergency management agency for local distribution information.

### County Emergency Management Resources

Alabama has 67 counties, each with an emergency management office responsible for local flood response. Distribution programs vary by county.

**Key contacts for flood-prone areas:**

- **Mobile County**: Mobile County Emergency Management Agency — (251) 460-8000
- **Baldwin County** (Gulf Shores, Daphne): Baldwin County EMA — (251) 972-6807
- **Jefferson County** (Birmingham): Jefferson County EMA — (205) 254-2039
- **Madison County** (Huntsville): Madison County EMA — (256) 532-3463
- **Montgomery County**: Montgomery County EMA — (334) 832-4980
- **Tuscaloosa County**: Tuscaloosa County EMA — (205) 464-8880

During active flood events, call 211 for the nearest sandbag distribution location in your area.

### Hardware and Farm Supply Stores

Standard sandbags are available year-round at Lowe's, Home Depot, Tractor Supply, and independent hardware stores throughout Alabama. Coastal locations typically increase stock in advance of hurricane season. During active flood warnings, store supplies deplete quickly — plan ahead.

## Storm Surge Guidance for Coastal Alabama

Coastal homeowners in Mobile and Baldwin counties face storm surge as their primary flood threat from named storms. Understanding surge risk is different from understanding river or flash flood risk.

**Storm surge key facts:**
- Storm surge is the abnormal rise in sea level caused by a hurricane's wind and pressure system pushing water onshore
- The height of surge depends on storm intensity, track, storm size, and coastal geometry
- Mobile Bay's shape concentrates surge from storms approaching from the south or southwest
- Surge can arrive before a storm's rain bands — water may be rising before wind damage begins

**Surge-specific preparation:**
- Sandbags are most effective against minor surge and the peripheral effects of major storms — they will not hold back a 10–15 foot surge from a direct major hurricane hit
- Primary protection from major surge is evacuation — know your zone's evacuation order
- Mobile County and Baldwin County use color-coded evacuation zones (A–F, with Zone A being highest risk) — know your zone before storm season begins
- Sandbag doorways, garage entries, and crawl space vents against expected surge of 1–3 feet
- HVAC units and other ground-level mechanical equipment should be elevated or protected with sandbag rings

## Flood Preparation Tips for Alabama Residents

### Know Your Flood Zone

Check your property's flood zone designation using FEMA's Flood Map Service Center at [msc.fema.gov](https://msc.fema.gov). Properties in Zone A or AE face the highest river and coastal flooding risk. Zone V properties along the Gulf Coast face additional wave action risk.

### Pre-Season Sandbag Stockpiling

Coastal and river-adjacent properties benefit from maintaining a sandbag supply before hurricane season (June 1–November 30) and before the spring flood season (March–May). Distribution sites run out during high-demand events.

A supply of 50–150 bags (depending on property size and flood exposure) with adequate sand provides meaningful protection for most residential scenarios.

### Stay Connected to County Emergency Management

Most Alabama county emergency management agencies now maintain active social media channels and sign-up-based alert systems (CodeRED or similar). Sign up for your county's emergency notification system before storm season. These alerts are typically the fastest way to learn about sandbag distribution sites when they open.

## Key Flood-Prone Areas in Alabama

### Mobile

Alabama's only major Gulf port city, Mobile has extensive flood exposure from storm surge, heavy rainfall, tidal flooding, and river flooding from the Mobile and Tombigbee rivers. Certain neighborhoods — including Africatown, Prichard, Chickasaw, and areas along Dog River — face particularly significant recurring flood risk.

### Birmingham Metro

Jefferson County and its surrounding counties represent one of the most urban flood-risk areas in the state. Flash flooding is the dominant threat, with Shades Creek, Village Creek, and Cahaba River flooding recorded in numerous residential and commercial areas. Heavy thunderstorm events regularly produce 24-hour rainfall totals of 3–6 inches.

### Huntsville

Madison County has seen significant flood damage from multiple events, including notable flooding in 2009. Flint Creek, Village Creek, and other drainages threaten residential areas across the Huntsville metro. TVA reservoir management reduces but does not eliminate downstream risk.

### Montgomery

The state capital sits along the Alabama River, which drains a vast central Alabama watershed. Major rainfall across the interior of the state drives river levels at Montgomery, with significant flood events recorded in the city's lower-lying areas.
