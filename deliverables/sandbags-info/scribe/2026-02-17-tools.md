# Sandbag Calculators & Tools

Guessing how many sandbags you need is how people end up either running short mid-storm or throwing away thousands of unused bags after a flood event. These calculators give you accurate estimates before you order, so you buy the right amount the first time.

All tools on this page are free to use. No sign-up required.

## Available Tools

### [Sandbag Calculator — How Many Sandbags Do You Need?](/sandbag-calculator/)

The primary planning tool for any flood protection project. Enter your wall dimensions — length, height, and number of walls — and the calculator returns:

- Total bags needed
- Estimated total weight (filled)
- Estimated cost range based on bag type and quantity tier

This calculator is the starting point for every sandbag project, whether you're sealing a single door or building a perimeter barrier around a property.

**Use it when:** You're estimating for a purchase order, requesting a delivery quote, or planning a municipal deployment.

### [Sandbag Weight Calculator](/sandbag-weight-calculator/)

Filled sandbags are heavy. A single standard bag (14"×26") filled with sand weighs 35–40 lbs. When you're loading a truck, placing bags on elevated surfaces, or coordinating volunteer labor, the weight math matters.

The sandbag weight calculator helps you estimate:

- Total weight of a filled order based on quantity and fill material
- Weight per layer in a stacked wall configuration
- Load requirements for vehicles and elevated storage platforms

**Use it when:** You need to verify vehicle capacity before pickup, coordinate labor based on total weight, or specify structural load for storage or deployment surfaces.

### [Sandbag Wall Calculator — Height, Length & Quantity](/sandbag-wall-calculator/)

Planning a specific sandbag wall — not just an order quantity? This tool walks through wall configuration specifically:

- Input: wall length, target height, stacking pattern
- Output: bags per layer, number of layers, total bags, and base width required for structural stability

Includes guidance on the pyramid stacking method and shows how base width requirements change as wall height increases.

**Use it when:** You're designing a wall layout, building in a constrained space, or need to verify that your bag count supports your target height across your planned wall length.

### Flood Damage Cost Calculator

How much does it cost to protect your home with sandbags versus the average cost of flood damage without protection? This calculator will use FEMA damage data by structure type and flood depth to produce a comparison — making the economic case for flood preparation concrete and specific to your situation.

**Planned launch:** Phase 2 production schedule.

## How to Use These Tools Together

For a complete pre-purchase workflow:

1. **Start with the [Sandbag Calculator](/sandbag-calculator/)** — get your total bag count
2. **Check the [Sandbag Weight Calculator](/sandbag-weight-calculator/)** — verify your transport and labor can handle the total weight
3. **Use the [Sandbag Wall Calculator](/sandbag-wall-calculator/)** — confirm your bag count supports your target wall configuration

Then use your quantity and specification from step 1 to [request a delivery quote](/contact/) or shop our [bulk sandbags guide](/bulk-sandbags/) for sourcing options.
