# Sandbag Wall Calculator

This calculator estimates how many sandbags you need for a specific wall configuration — accounting for wall length, target height, bag size, and stacking pattern. It goes beyond a simple quantity estimate by showing you how many layers you need, how many bags per layer, and how wide the base should be to keep the wall stable.

## How to Calculate Sandbag Wall Quantities Manually

If you need to calculate before the interactive tool is available, use the method below.

### Step 1: Determine Bags Per Layer

For **14"×26" bags** placed lengthwise along the wall:
- Each bag covers approximately 26 inches (2.17 ft) of wall length
- Bags per layer = Wall length (ft) ÷ 2.17

For **18"×30" bags:**
- Each bag covers approximately 30 inches (2.5 ft) of wall length
- Bags per layer = Wall length (ft) ÷ 2.5

*Round up to the nearest whole bag.*

### Step 2: Determine Number of Layers

A single layer of standard 14"×26" sandbags (filled two-thirds) stands approximately 5–6 inches tall when compressed. For 18"×30" bags, approximately 6–7 inches per layer.

**Layers needed by target height:**

| Target Height | Standard 14"×26" | Large 18"×30" |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------|
| 6 inches | 1 layer | 1 layer |
| 1 foot | 2 layers | 2 layers |
| 18 inches | 3 layers | 2–3 layers |
| 2 feet | 4 layers | 3–4 layers |
| 3 feet | 6 layers | 5 layers |

### Step 3: Apply the Pyramid Offset

In a properly built pyramid-pattern wall, each layer back slightly toward the water-facing side. This increases the total number of bags because higher layers are set in from the outer edge. The first layer is the widest and longest; upper layers are progressively narrower.

**Approximate multiplier for pyramid vs. single-stack:**
- 2-layer wall: 1.15× (minimal pyramid)
- 3-layer wall: 1.25×
- 4-layer wall: 1.35×
- 6-layer wall: 1.55×

### Step 4: Calculate Total Bags

> **Total bags = (Bags per layer) × (Layers) × (Pyramid multiplier)**

**Example:** 20-foot wall, 2-foot target height, standard 14"×26" bags
- Bags per layer: 20 ÷ 2.17 = 9.2 → 10 bags
- Layers needed: 4
- Pyramid multiplier for 4 layers: 1.35
- Total: 10 × 4 × 1.35 = **54 bags**

## Wall Configuration Reference Table

Standard 14"×26" bags, two-thirds fill, pyramid stacking pattern:

| Wall Length | 1-ft Height | 2-ft Height | 3-ft Height |
|-------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 10 ft | 12–15 bags | 50–60 bags | 90–110 bags |
| 20 ft | 22–28 bags | 95–115 bags | 175–215 bags |
| 30 ft | 35–42 bags | 140–170 bags | 260–320 bags |
| 50 ft | 58–70 bags | 235–285 bags | 435–530 bags |
| 100 ft | 115–140 bags | 465–565 bags | 860–1,050 bags |

*Ranges reflect variability in fill level, ground surface, and exact stacking execution.*

## Base Width Requirements for Stability

Wall stability depends on the relationship between height and base width. A narrow base with a tall wall fails under hydraulic pressure. The pyramid stacking method automatically builds a widening base as you add layers — but you need to plan for the space.

**Recommended minimum base width by wall height:**

| Target Height | Minimum Base Width | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------|
| 1 foot | 12–15 inches | Single layer; minimal base |
| 2 feet | 24–30 inches | Stable for typical flood barrier |
| 3 feet | 36–48 inches | Requires 2–3 bag widths at base |
| 4 feet | 48–60 inches | Beyond standard DIY; consult emergency management |

If your available space is narrower than the minimum base width for your target height, reduce your target height. A well-built 18-inch wall is more effective than a 3-foot wall that collapses.

## How Wall Height Affects Flood Protection

More height is not always better — the incremental protection value diminishes and the structural demands increase significantly.

**What different wall heights protect against:**

**1 foot (2 layers):** Protects door thresholds, low window wells, and sloped entries from minor flooding. Most effective for the first 6–12 inches of flood water.

**2 feet (4 layers):** The practical standard for residential flood barriers. Handles typical flash flooding and river overflow events. This is the height referenced in most FEMA guidance for home protection.

**3 feet (5–6 layers):** Requires significantly more bags, a wider base, and is increasingly difficult to build without equipment. Best suited for properties with no other flood control infrastructure. At this height, consider whether a professional installation or alternative flood barrier (AquaDam, Tiger Dam) is a better option.

**Above 3 feet:** Not recommended for DIY construction with standard sandbags. Hydraulic forces at this height exceed what a typical sandbag wall can withstand without engineered reinforcement. Contact your local emergency management agency for guidance.

## Protecting the Wall Ends

Every sandbag wall calculation needs to account for the ends — where the wall terminates. Unprotected ends allow water to flow around the barrier even if the wall itself is structurally sound.

**End treatment options:**

- **L-turn:** The last 3–5 bags of each end turn perpendicular to the wall direction, forming an L-shape. This redirects flow away from the end rather than letting it curl around.
- **Tie into structure:** Where possible, run the wall end flush against a building wall, foundation, or raised ground to eliminate the gap entirely.
- **Angled extension:** On sloped ground, extend the wall uphill so the end is above the expected water level.

Add 15–20 bags per end to your total calculation for L-turn end treatments.

## After Your Calculation: Next Steps

Once you have your total bag count:

1. **Verify transport capacity** — use the [sandbag weight calculator](/sandbag-weight-calculator/) to confirm your vehicles or delivery service can handle the total weight
2. **Source bags** — see the [bulk sandbags guide](/bulk-sandbags/) for pallet/truckload buying options, or [request a delivery quote](/contact/)
3. **Review the build guide** — [DIY sandbag wall: step-by-step](/diy-sandbag-wall/) covers the full construction process before you start placing bags
