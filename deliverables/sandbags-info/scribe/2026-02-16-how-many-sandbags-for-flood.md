### Introduction

"How many sandbags do I need?" is the most practical question in flood prep — and it's also one of the hardest to answer without a framework. Order too few and your barrier is incomplete. Order too many and you've wasted money and time hauling excess bags.

The answer depends on three variables: the **length** of barrier you need to build, the **height** of that barrier, and the **stacking method** you use. This guide gives you the formula, the quick-reference tables, and the real-world scenarios so you can calculate your sandbag needs accurately.

For a quick automated answer, use our [sandbag calculator](/sandbag-calculator/). For the math behind it, read on.

## The Sandbag Quantity Formula

The core formula for sandbag quantity:

**Total Bags = Barrier Length (ft) × Bags Per Linear Foot Per Row × Number of Rows**

### Breaking Down the Variables

**Bags per linear foot per row:**  
A standard 14"×26" sandbag placed flat takes up approximately 12 inches (1 foot) of linear barrier. So 1 bag = 1 linear foot per row. (In practice, you'll overlap slightly, so use **0.9–1.0 bags per linear foot** as your multiplier.)

**Number of rows by barrier height:**

| Barrier Height | Rows Required (Standard Stack) |
|---|---|
| 6 inches | 1 row |
| 12 inches (1 foot) | 2 rows |
| 18 inches | 3 rows |
| 24 inches (2 feet) | 4 rows |
| 30 inches | 5 rows |
| 36 inches (3 feet) | 6 rows |

**But wait — pyramid construction:**  
A proper sandbag barrier uses a pyramid/stagger structure that requires a **wider base than top**. For a pyramid-stacked barrier, the base width equals approximately half the height. This means:

- A 2-foot-tall barrier needs a 3-layer pyramid (base = 3 bags wide × length)
- A 3-foot-tall barrier needs a 4-5 layer pyramid (base = 4-5 bags wide × length)

The **practical multiplier** for pyramid construction:

| Barrier Height | Bag Multiplier per Linear Foot |
|---|---|
| 1 foot (2 rows) | 3 bags/linear foot |
| 2 feet (3–4 rows pyramid) | 8–10 bags/linear foot |
| 3 feet (5–6 rows pyramid) | 15–18 bags/linear foot |

### Example Calculation

**Goal:** Protect a 30-foot driveway from 2 feet of floodwater.  
**Formula:** 30 ft × 10 bags/linear foot = **300 sandbags**  
**With 15% buffer:** 345 bags

## By Flood Depth: 1-Foot, 2-Foot, 3-Foot Scenarios

Real flood situations require thinking about **what height barrier you need relative to flood depth**, not just how tall you want to build.

### Engineering Rule: Build 30% Above Expected Flood Depth

If your forecast says 12 inches of water, build a barrier 15–18 inches tall. Never build a barrier exactly at the expected water level — you want freeboard (safety margin above the water line) of at least 6 inches.

### Scenario 1: 1-Foot (12-inch) Flood Depth

**Recommended barrier height:** 18 inches  
**Barrier type:** 3-row stagger stack  
**Bags per linear foot:** ~5  

| Protection Zone | Linear Feet | Bags Required |
|---|---|---|
| Single door | 6 ft | 30 bags |
| Front of house (40 ft) | 40 ft | 200 bags |
| Full house perimeter (120 ft) | 120 ft | 600 bags |

### Scenario 2: 2-Foot (24-inch) Flood Depth

**Recommended barrier height:** 30–36 inches  
**Barrier type:** Pyramid construction (4–5 rows, 3-bag base)  
**Bags per linear foot:** ~12  

| Protection Zone | Linear Feet | Bags Required |
|---|---|---|
| Single door | 6 ft | 75 bags |
| Front of house (40 ft) | 40 ft | 480 bags |
| Full house perimeter (120 ft) | 120 ft | 1,440 bags |

### Scenario 3: 3-Foot (36-inch) Flood Depth

**Recommended barrier height:** 42–48 inches  
**Barrier type:** Full pyramid levee (5–6 rows, 4-bag base)  
**Bags per linear foot:** ~20  

| Protection Zone | Linear Feet | Bags Required |
|---|---|---|
| Front of house (40 ft) | 40 ft | 800 bags |
| Full house perimeter (120 ft) | 120 ft | 2,400 bags |

**Note:** At 3-foot flood depth, protecting a full house perimeter with sandbags requires thousands of bags and significant labor. This scale typically requires emergency management coordination and heavy equipment. Individual homeowner sandbag efforts are best focused on critical entry points (doors, garage, vents) at this flood depth.

<a name="buffer"></a>
## Buffer Quantity: How Much Extra to Order

Always order more than your calculation suggests. Real-world variables that consume extra bags:

- **Uneven ground**: Low spots in your foundation or yard require extra bags to fill gaps
- **Bag failures**: Approximately 1–3% of bags tear during filling or deployment
- **Unexpected entry points**: You'll find weak spots you didn't plan for
- **Levee height adjustments**: Water often rises more than forecast

**Standard buffer recommendation:**
- Projects under 100 bags: Add 20%
- Projects 100–500 bags: Add 15%
- Projects over 500 bags: Add 10%

## What to Do If You Don't Have Enough Sandbags

Sandbags are the most commonly undersupplied resource during flood emergencies. If you can't get enough:

**Triage your protection:**
1. Protect entry points first (doors, garage) — these prevent interior flooding
2. Protect vents and low windows second
3. Build a perimeter only if you have the bags to do it properly

**DIY alternatives for gaps:**
- Partially filled trash bags stuffed with soil make surprisingly effective temporary gap fillers
- Rolled tarps secured with stakes can redirect water from doors in low-water situations
- Plastic sheeting (poly tarp) staked to the ground and weighted with whatever heavy objects you have can slow sheet flooding

**Where to get emergency sandbags fast:**  
Read our guide to [emergency sandbag locations](/emergency-sandbag-locations/) for government distribution points and alternatives.
