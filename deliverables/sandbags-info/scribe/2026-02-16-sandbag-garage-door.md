### Introduction

In a flood, your garage door is often the first thing to fail. Most homeowners focus sandbag efforts on front and back entry doors — but a standard garage door sits on a track with a rubber weatherstrip bottom seal that was never designed to hold back water. The bottom seal flexes, the door panels gap at the sides, and even modest water depth finds its way through.

A flooded garage doesn't just mean wet boxes and ruined bikes. Floodwater entering the garage can seep into the main living structure, damage the electrical panel, and compromise vehicles, HVAC equipment, and structural elements. In many homes, the garage is the weak link — and sandbags are the fastest way to address it.

This guide covers why garage doors are vulnerable, how to build an effective sandbag barrier for a garage door, and when to choose an L-shaped barrier over a straight one.

For the complete door barrier method (applicable to any door type), see: [How to Seal a Door with Sandbags](/sandbag-door-barrier/)

## Why Garage Doors Are Flood Vulnerable

Standard overhead garage doors have several structural characteristics that make them poor flood barriers:

### Wide Span, Minimal Sealing
A typical single-car garage door is 9 feet wide. A double-car door is 16–18 feet wide. That's a long bottom seal — and every inch of that seal is a potential entry point. Even new rubber weatherstrips have some flex and gaps, and older weatherstrips crack and curl.

### Side Gaps
Overhead garage doors ride on vertical tracks with 1/4-to-3/8-inch gaps between the door panel edges and the track frame. These gaps run the full height of the door. In a flood, water climbs those gaps quickly.

### No Threshold
Unlike a front door with a raised threshold, most garage floors are level with (or slightly below) the driveway. There's zero elevation to slow incoming water.

### Structural Pressure Limits
Garage door panels are designed for wind load, not hydrostatic pressure. Even 12 inches of standing water against a standard garage door creates several hundred pounds of horizontal force — enough to visibly bow the panels inward and gap the seams.

## Straight Barrier vs. L-Shaped Barrier

You have two fundamental configurations when sandbagging a garage door. The right choice depends on your driveway geometry and how water approaches.

### Straight Barrier
A row of sandbags running parallel to the garage door, placed 12–24 inches in front of the door.

**Best for:**
- Driveways that slope toward the garage (water sheets down the driveway)
- Situations where water approaches primarily from the front
- Quicker setup (fewer bags, simpler construction)

**Limitation:** A straight barrier doesn't stop water from coming around the sides. If your property floods from the side or if water flows along the garage wall, the straight barrier will be flanked.

### L-Shaped Barrier
A straight barrier in front of the door, with two perpendicular "wings" extending back along each side of the garage to meet the house wall.

**Best for:**
- Sheet flooding that comes from multiple directions
- Sloped lots where water flows diagonally across the driveway
- Higher water depths (over 12 inches)
- Maximum protection when time and bags allow

**The L-shape principle:** The wings turn the barrier into a contained basin in front of the door, forcing water to climb over instead of around the barrier.

## How to Build a Straight Garage Door Barrier

### Materials
- Sandbags: 40–80 bags for a single-car garage door (2–3 rows)
- Sandbags: 70–140 bags for a double-car door (2–3 rows)
- 6-mil polyethylene sheeting
- Work gloves, rubber boots

### Steps

**1. Clear the driveway** in front of the garage door. Remove vehicles, bikes, and any debris within 6 feet of the door.

**2. Lay poly sheeting.** Place a 6-mil tarp across the full width of the garage door, extending 3 feet outward onto the driveway and 12 inches inside the garage (under the door if possible). The width of the tarp should be the full door width plus 2 feet on each side.

**3. Build the first row.** Place bags flat, parallel to the door, centered 12–18 inches in front of the door. Each bag's long axis runs parallel to the door (left-right). Extend the first row 18–24 inches past each end of the door — this is critical for preventing flank seepage. Tamp each bag firmly.

**4. Stagger and stack.** Second and third rows follow the brick-laying stagger pattern. Each row is pulled slightly back (toward the door) to build a gentle pyramid face on the outward side.

**5. Seal the ends.** At each end of the barrier, place 2–3 additional bags turned perpendicular (running front-to-back), pressed tightly against the garage wall. This plugs the gap between the barrier end and the wall.

## How to Build an L-Shaped Barrier

The L-shaped barrier uses the straight barrier above as the front section, then adds two wings.

### Wing Construction

**After completing the straight barrier:**

**1. Measure the wing length.** Wings should run from each end of the straight barrier back along the garage wall to where the wall meets higher ground or the house foundation. Typical wing length: 4–10 feet per side.

**2. Lay poly sheeting for the wings** along each side before placing bags.

**3. Build the wings using the same 2–3 row method.** The inner row of each wing presses against the garage wall.

**4. Connect wing to straight barrier.** The corner where the wing meets the front barrier needs a tight pack of 3–4 extra bags to prevent the corner from being a seepage point.

**5. Seal at the house wall.** Where each wing meets the house wall, pack tightly against the wall and fill any gap with loose sand if available.

## How Many Sandbags for a Garage Door?

| Door Type | Flood Depth | Barrier Type | Bags Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single (9 ft) | 6–12 inches | Straight, 2 rows | 30–45 bags |
| Single (9 ft) | 12–24 inches | Straight, 3 rows | 50–70 bags |
| Single (9 ft) | 12–24 inches | L-shape, 3 rows | 80–120 bags |
| Double (16 ft) | 6–12 inches | Straight, 2 rows | 55–80 bags |
| Double (16 ft) | 12–24 inches | Straight, 3 rows | 90–120 bags |
| Double (16 ft) | 12–24 inches | L-shape, 3 rows | 140–180 bags |

## Inside the Garage: Secondary Protection

Even with a good exterior barrier, some water may seep through. Prepare the garage interior:

- **Elevate stored items**: Move boxes, tools, and valuables onto shelves or above the expected flood line
- **Position a secondary sandbag row inside**: A single row of 6–10 bags along the inside base of the garage door catches breakthrough seepage
- **Protect the electrical panel**: If your electrical panel is in the garage and at risk, sandbag around its base; better yet, have an electrician disconnect it before flooding arrives
- **Move vehicles early**: Don't wait until water is at the door — move vehicles at the 72-hour mark when flooding is forecasted

## Permanent Garage Flood Protection Options

If your home floods regularly, sandbags are a temporary solution. Permanent options include:

- **Garage door flood barriers**: Panel-style or inflatable barriers that install in the door opening
- **Automatic flood gates**: Motor-operated barriers that deploy when water sensors trigger
- **Raised garage floor threshold**: Contractors can pour a concrete berm across the garage opening
