# Emergency Flood Response Guide: What to Do in the First 24 Hours

When a flood warning hits, every hour matters. This step-by-step guide walks you through exactly what to do from the moment you receive a flood alert through the critical first 24 hours — protecting your family, your property, and your community.

Whether you're a homeowner facing your first flood or a community volunteer coordinating neighborhood response, follow these steps in order of priority: **people first, then property**.

## Hour 0-1: Immediate Response After Flood Warning

### Step 1: Verify the Threat and Assess Your Risk

**What you need:** Phone, NOAA Weather Radio, internet access

1. Confirm the flood warning through official sources — NOAA, National Weather Service, or local emergency management.
2. Determine the **type** of flood warning:
   - **Flash Flood Warning** — Immediate danger. Act NOW. You may have minutes, not hours.
   - **Flood Warning** — Flooding is imminent or occurring. You have hours to prepare.
   - **Flood Watch** — Conditions are favorable for flooding. Begin preparations.
3. Check predicted flood levels against your property elevation if known.
4. Monitor local emergency broadcasts for evacuation orders.

**Critical:** If you receive a Flash Flood Warning, skip ahead to evacuation planning. Flash floods kill more people than any other flood type because people underestimate the speed of rising water.

### Step 2: Activate Your Family Emergency Plan

**What you need:** Family communication plan, emergency contacts list

1. Account for all family members. Establish communication check-in times.
2. Confirm your evacuation route — have at least two options since roads may flood.
3. Identify your emergency meeting point if the family is separated.
4. Contact elderly neighbors, disabled residents, and anyone who may need assistance evacuating.
5. Arrange care for pets — confirm your evacuation destination accepts animals.

### Step 3: Prepare Your Emergency Go-Bag

If you don't have a pre-packed bag (you should — see our [flood preparation checklist](/flood-preparation-checklist/)), assemble these essentials now:

1. Important documents in waterproof container (IDs, insurance policies, deeds, medical records)
2. Medications — minimum 7-day supply for all family members
3. Phone chargers, portable battery packs
4. Cash (ATMs and card readers fail during power outages)
5. Change of clothes and rain gear for each person
6. First aid kit
7. Flashlights and extra batteries
8. Bottled water (1 gallon per person per day for 3 days)
9. Non-perishable food and manual can opener

## Hour 1-4: Property Protection

### Step 4: Secure Your Home's Exterior

**What you need:** Sandbags, plastic sheeting, basic tools

1. **Clear drains and gutters** — Remove leaves and debris from storm drains, downspouts, and yard drains. Blocked drains cause preventable flooding.
2. **Disconnect downspouts** from underground drain tiles if those systems are at capacity.
3. **Move vehicles** to high ground. Vehicles are often the most expensive flood loss after the structure itself.
4. **Secure or move outdoor items** — Patio furniture, grills, trash cans, and yard equipment become battering rams in floodwater.
5. **Shut off propane tanks** and anchor them to prevent flotation.

### Step 5: Deploy Sandbags

**What you need:** Sandbags (pre-filled or empty bags + sand), shovel, plastic sheeting, work gloves

This is where most of your property protection time will be spent. If you don't have sandbags on hand, locate your nearest [sandbag distribution center](/sandbag-distribution-centers/) immediately.

**Filling sandbags (if not pre-filled):**

1. Work in teams of two — one holds the bag open, one shovels.
2. Fill bags only **half to two-thirds full** (about 35-40 lbs each). Overfilled bags don't conform to surfaces and leave gaps.
3. Don't tie the bags closed. Fold the open end under and lay bags fold-side-down.
4. A two-person team can fill approximately 50-80 bags per hour by hand. For larger operations, a [sandbag filling machine](/sandbag-filling-machine/) dramatically increases output.

**Placing sandbags effectively:**

1. Start at the **lowest point** where water will enter your property.
2. Place bags lengthwise, parallel to the direction of water flow.
3. Stagger bags like bricks — offset each row by half a bag length.
4. Tamp each bag into place with your feet to eliminate gaps.
5. **Place plastic sheeting** on the water side of the sandbag wall for a much more effective water barrier.
6. Build walls wider at the base — a 3-foot-high wall should be at least 2 bags wide at the bottom.

**How many sandbags do you need?**

- Doorway protection (1 foot high): 6-10 bags
- Single door flood barrier (2 feet high): 20-30 bags
- Garage door (2 feet high): 40-60 bags
- 20-foot property wall (2 feet high): 150-200 bags
- 100-foot perimeter (3 feet high): 1,500-2,000 bags

### Step 6: Protect Home Interior and Utilities

**What you need:** Plastic bins, plastic sheeting, tape

1. **Turn off electricity** at the breaker panel if flooding threatens electrical outlets, wiring, or appliances. Do this BEFORE water reaches electrical systems.
2. **Shut off natural gas** at the meter if water may reach gas appliances.
3. **Move valuables upstairs** or to the highest point in your home — electronics, photo albums, important documents, irreplaceable items.
4. **Elevate appliances** if possible — place washers, dryers, and water heaters on concrete blocks.
5. **Install check valves** on sewer lines if not already present (this is ideally a pre-flood-season task).
6. **Seal basement entries** — Apply plastic sheeting over basement windows and window wells, secured with sandbags.
7. **Plug basement floor drains** with expandable rubber plugs to prevent sewer backflow.

### Step 7: Document Everything for Insurance

**What you need:** Phone camera, notepad

1. **Photograph or video your entire property** — inside and out — BEFORE flooding starts. This pre-flood documentation is invaluable for insurance claims.
2. Record serial numbers of major appliances and electronics.
3. Note the time and date of each photo.
4. Upload images to cloud storage immediately — your phone may not survive the flood.

## Hour 4-12: Monitor and Adapt

### Step 8: Establish a Monitoring Routine

**What you need:** NOAA Weather Radio, charged phone, measuring reference

1. Check official flood forecasts every 30 minutes.
2. Monitor water levels near your property — mark a reference point and note the time and level hourly.
3. Watch for changes in water speed, color, or debris content — muddy, fast-moving water carrying debris indicates escalating danger.
4. Listen for unusual sounds — rushing water, cracking trees, or structural groaning.

### Step 9: Know When to Evacuate

**Evacuate immediately if any of the following occur:**

- Water is rising faster than predicted
- You receive an official evacuation order
- Water enters your home despite protective measures
- You hear structural sounds (cracking, shifting)
- The sandbag barrier shows signs of failure
- You smell gas
- Water reaches electrical systems you couldn't de-energize

**Evacuation safety rules:**

1. **Never walk through moving water.** Six inches of fast-moving water can knock an adult off their feet.
2. **Never drive through flooded roads.** Two feet of water will float most vehicles. "Turn around, don't drown" saves lives every year.
3. **Move to higher ground, not into enclosed spaces.** Attics without roof access have become fatal traps.
4. If trapped, go to the highest floor. Signal for rescue from a window or rooftop. Call 911.

### Step 10: Support Community Response

If your property is secure and you're not in immediate danger:

1. Check on neighbors, especially elderly and disabled residents.
2. Report road flooding and infrastructure damage to local authorities.
3. Volunteer at [sandbag distribution centers](/sandbag-distribution-centers/) if able.
4. Share verified information on social media — combat misinformation by citing official sources only.
5. Document community conditions with photos and video for emergency responders.

## Hour 12-24: Sustained Operations

### Step 11: Maintain Your Flood Defenses

Sandbag barriers and other flood protection measures require ongoing attention:

1. **Inspect sandbag walls** every 2-4 hours. Look for settling, shifting, and seepage.
2. **Add bags** where water is topping or flowing around barriers.
3. **Address piping** — If you see water flowing through or under the sandbag wall in a concentrated stream, that's piping failure. Place additional bags and plastic sheeting at the entry point immediately.
4. **Pump water** that breaches barriers. Keep sump pumps and backup power ready.
5. **Reinforce vulnerable points** — Doorways, window wells, and utility penetrations are common failure points.

### Step 12: Manage Fatigue and Resources

Flood response is physically and mentally exhausting. During sustained operations:

1. **Rotate rest periods** — You cannot maintain vigilance for 24 hours straight. Take turns monitoring.
2. **Stay hydrated and eat** — Fatigue impairs decision-making when you need it most.
3. **Conserve phone battery** — Reduce screen brightness, close unnecessary apps, enable power-saving mode.
4. **Ration supplies** — If the flood lasts longer than expected, you'll need reserves.

### Step 13: Prepare for Recovery

Even while the flood is ongoing, begin planning recovery:

1. Contact your insurance company to initiate a claim. Don't wait until water recedes.
2. Research FEMA disaster assistance and SBA disaster loans — applications can take weeks to process.
3. Identify water restoration companies in your area. They book up fast after major floods.
4. Plan your re-entry — don't return to a flooded property until authorities confirm it's safe.

## After the Water Recedes

### Step 14: Safe Re-Entry

1. **Do not enter your home** until local authorities say it's safe.
2. **Check for structural damage** before entering — look for foundation cracks, sagging roofs, and shifted walls.
3. **Check for gas leaks** — If you smell gas, leave immediately and call your utility company.
4. **Don't turn on electricity** until an electrician inspects your system.
5. **Photograph all damage** before cleanup begins — your insurer needs this documentation.
6. **Wear protective equipment** — Rubber boots, gloves, N95 mask. Floodwater is contaminated.

### Step 15: Sandbag Disposal

Used flood sandbags require proper disposal:

1. **Do not reuse sandbags** exposed to contaminated floodwater.
2. Check with your municipality for designated disposal sites.
3. Burlap bags with clean sand fill may be composted; synthetic bags go to landfill.
4. Do not dump sand from flood-exposed bags in gardens or play areas.
