# Bulk Sandbags: Where to Buy by the Pallet or Truckload

Buying sandbags one at a time from a hardware store makes sense if you need twenty. If you need two thousand, you need a different approach.

Bulk sandbag purchasing — by the pallet, super sack, or truckload — is standard practice for municipalities, contractors, property managers, and homeowners in high-risk flood zones who stock up before storm season. This guide covers everything you need to know: bag types, pricing benchmarks, where to buy, and how delivery works at scale.

## What Counts as a "Bulk" Sandbag Order?

There's no official threshold, but most suppliers define bulk as 100 bags or more. Pallet quantities typically run 500–1,000 bags depending on bag size and material. Truckload quantities run 10,000–50,000+ bags.

The price-per-bag drops significantly at scale. A polypropylene sandbag that costs $0.80–$1.00 each in quantities of 50 may cost $0.25–$0.40 each when ordered by the pallet.

**Common bulk order tiers:**

| Quantity | Common Use Case | Typical Price/Bag |
|----------|----------------|-------------------|
| 100–499 | Residential flood prep | $0.50–$1.20 |
| 500–999 (1 pallet) | Small contractor, property manager | $0.30–$0.75 |
| 1,000–4,999 (2–5 pallets) | Municipality, commercial property | $0.20–$0.50 |
| 5,000+ (truckload) | Government, large contractor | $0.15–$0.35 |

Prices vary by material, region, and current market conditions. Sand prices fluctuate, and bag material costs shift with petroleum markets (polypropylene) and agricultural cycles (burlap/jute).

## Sandbag Types Available in Bulk

### Polypropylene (Woven Poly)

The most common bulk sandbag on the market. Polypropylene woven bags are UV-resistant, moisture-resistant, and durable for outdoor deployment. They're available in standard sizes (14"×26" and 18"×30") and larger configurations. Most government emergency stockpiles use woven poly.

**Best for:** Flood protection, erosion control, long-term outdoor use.
**Bulk availability:** Excellent — most suppliers' primary product.

### Burlap

Natural fiber bags with good weight retention and a faster natural degradation rate than poly. Burlap sandbags absorb water differently and are sometimes preferred for temporary flood barriers where environmental impact is a concern.

**Best for:** Short-term use, applications where poly degradation is a disposal concern.
**Bulk availability:** Good — slightly less common than poly in large volumes.

### Jute

Similar to burlap but often finer weave. Preferred in some erosion control applications. Less common at truckload scale.

**Best for:** Erosion control, landscaping, biodegradable applications.
**Bulk availability:** Moderate — order lead times may be longer.

### Pre-Filled Sandbags

Some suppliers offer pre-filled bags delivered by pallet. Typically sand-filled, sealed, and ready to stack. Significantly heavier to ship (a pallet of pre-filled bags can weigh 2,000–4,000 lbs) and substantially more expensive per bag — but eliminates the labor and equipment needed for filling.

**Best for:** Emergency situations where filling equipment or labor isn't available; small residential orders.
**Bulk availability:** Limited at truckload scale; most practical at 100–500 bag quantities.

### Super Sacks / Bulk Bags

Large woven polypropylene bags (also called FIBCs — Flexible Intermediate Bulk Containers) that hold 1,000–2,000 lbs of fill material. Used as flood barriers in their own right when filled with sand or gravel. One super sack can replace 30–50 standard sandbags in terms of flood protection volume.

**Best for:** Commercial, industrial, and municipal applications; rapid deployment where standard-size bags aren't practical.
**Bulk availability:** Good through industrial suppliers.

## Where to Buy Bulk Sandbags

### Online Industrial Suppliers

The most competitive pricing for large orders is typically found through industrial packaging and agricultural supply companies. Key sources include:

- **Direct-from-manufacturer suppliers** — Companies like US Cargo Control, Sandbaggy, and similar industrial suppliers sell sandbags by the pallet with shipping to most US addresses.
- **Amazon Business** — Limited for large pallet orders but useful for quantities under 500 bags.
- **Regional agricultural suppliers** — Often carry burlap and jute bags at competitive prices.

Compare per-bag price, minimum order quantity, and shipping cost carefully. A low per-bag price with high freight can exceed a slightly higher-priced local option once totals are calculated.

### Local Suppliers and Distributors

For orders of 1,000+ bags, freight cost from a distant supplier often makes a regional or local distributor more competitive. Local suppliers to check:

- **Farm and ranch supply stores** (Tractor Supply Co., Rural King) — carry woven poly bags; call ahead for bulk pricing on quantities over 500
- **Building materials distributors** — often stock standard sandbags and can source in quantity
- **Concrete and masonry suppliers** — sometimes carry bags for construction applications
- **Local emergency management stockpile programs** — some counties and municipalities have pre-positioned stock they sell or distribute to residents and contractors

### Government Surplus and Emergency Programs

During declared flood emergencies, FEMA and state emergency management agencies sometimes activate free sandbag distribution programs. These are not reliable sources for pre-event planning but are worth knowing:

- **County emergency management offices** — maintain distribution center lists; some operate their own filling stations
- **National Guard depots** — have been used as distribution points in major flood events
- **FEMA disaster programs** — post-disaster supplies, not pre-event

For a current list of distribution centers and free sandbag programs, see our [emergency sandbag locations guide](/emergency-sandbag-locations/).

### Sandbag Delivery Services

For residential and commercial buyers who want bulk quantities delivered without arranging freight themselves, sandbag delivery services handle the logistics. These services:

- Deliver empty or pre-filled bags to your address
- Often offer same-day or next-day service in flood-prone regions
- Can coordinate with filling services so bags arrive ready to stack
- Serve both residential and commercial accounts

See our [sandbag delivery services guide](/sandbag-delivery-services/) for a full breakdown of how these services work, what they cost, and how to find one in your area.

## Pricing Breakdown: What Drives Bulk Sandbag Costs

Understanding what affects price helps you shop more effectively.

**Material:** Polypropylene bags cost less per unit than burlap or jute at scale. Pre-filled bags cost 3–10× the price of empty bags when including fill and labor.

**Bag size:** Standard 14"×26" bags are cheapest. Larger 18"×30" bags cost more but hold more volume. Super sacks have completely different pricing — per-bag cost is high but per-cubic-foot cost can be lower.

**UV rating:** Bags rated for 1,000+ hours of UV exposure cost slightly more than standard poly bags. For outdoor deployments lasting more than 30–60 days, UV-rated bags prevent premature degradation and are worth the premium.

**Minimum order quantities:** Suppliers with 500-bag minimums often have better unit pricing than those selling 100-bag minimums. If you can consolidate purchasing with a neighbor, contractor, or HOA, you'll get better pricing.

**Shipping and freight:** Freight is the hidden cost in bulk sandbag purchasing. A pallet of 500 standard empty sandbags weighs 50–100 lbs and ships relatively cheaply. A pallet of 500 pre-filled bags can weigh 10,000–15,000 lbs and requires LTL freight — budget $200–$600 for freight on top of product cost.

## How Many Bags Do You Need?

Before placing a bulk order, calculate your actual quantity requirement. Buying short means a second order with second freight costs; buying far over means storage and eventual disposal costs.

Rules of thumb:
- **Protect a standard door opening** (3 ft wide, pile 2 ft high): 30–50 bags
- **One linear foot of sandbag wall, 1 foot high**: 3–5 bags
- **One linear foot of sandbag wall, 2 feet high**: 15–20 bags
- **Full perimeter of a 2,000 sq ft home** (200 linear feet, 2 ft high): 3,000–4,000 bags

For a precise count, use our [sandbag wall calculator](/sandbag-wall-calculator/) or [sandbag calculator](/sandbag-calculator/). These tools let you enter your dimensions and return a bag count plus estimated weight and cost range.

## Storing Bulk Sandbags

Empty sandbags stored correctly can last 3–5 years or longer. Key storage rules:

- **Keep out of direct sunlight.** UV exposure degrades polypropylene rapidly; store in a covered area.
- **Keep dry.** Moisture causes mold in natural fiber bags (burlap, jute) and can degrade poly ties and stitching.
- **Stack on pallets.** Keep bags off concrete floors to prevent moisture wicking.
- **Inspect annually.** Check for UV degradation (brittleness, crumbling fabric), pest damage, and stitching failure before you need to rely on the bags.
