## Polypropylene vs. Burlap Sandbags

When you're choosing sandbags for flood protection, erosion control, or emergency preparedness, the material matters as much as the fill. The two dominant materials on the market — polypropylene (woven plastic) and burlap (natural jute fiber) — each have distinct strengths and clear weaknesses. Understanding the difference can save you money, ensure your barriers hold, and keep you on the right side of local disposal regulations.

This comparison covers every key variable: durability, UV resistance, cost, environmental impact, and practical use cases.

## What Are Polypropylene Sandbags?

Polypropylene sandbags are woven from synthetic plastic fibers — the same base material used in tarps, rope, and packaging fabric. They're the default option at most hardware stores, government emergency suppliers, and online retailers.

The weave creates a strong, flexible bag that resists tearing even under heavy fill loads. Most polypropylene sandbags are available in a standard 14" × 26" size and hold between 35–50 lbs when filled with sand. They're offered in natural (off-white), green, and tan colors.

### Key Properties of Polypropylene Sandbags

- **Material:** Woven polypropylene (synthetic plastic)
- **Typical weight (empty):** 0.5–0.75 lbs
- **Filled weight:** 35–50 lbs
- **UV resistance:** Moderate (degrades with prolonged sun exposure unless UV-stabilized)
- **Decomposition:** Non-biodegradable; persists for decades
- **Water absorption:** Minimal — the bag itself doesn't absorb water
- **Typical lifespan (deployed):** 6–12 months standard; up to 2 years with UV-stabilized versions

## What Are Burlap Sandbags?

Burlap sandbags are made from jute — a natural plant fiber grown primarily in Bangladesh, India, and China. Jute is woven into a coarse, breathable fabric that has been used for sandbag construction for well over a century.

Burlap sandbags are biodegradable, which makes them the preferred choice in applications where the bags will be left in place long-term and where removing plastic waste would be difficult or impractical.

### Key Properties of Burlap Sandbags

- **Material:** Woven jute (natural fiber)
- **Typical weight (empty):** 0.75–1.0 lbs
- **Filled weight:** 35–50 lbs
- **UV resistance:** Low — jute degrades quickly in direct sunlight
- **Decomposition:** Fully biodegradable; breaks down in 2–5 years
- **Water absorption:** High — the bag itself absorbs water and swells slightly, which can improve sealing against leakage
- **Typical lifespan (deployed):** 3–6 months in exposed conditions; longer if shaded or buried

## Head-to-Head Comparison

### Durability

**Polypropylene wins on raw durability.** The synthetic weave resists tearing, abrasion, and moisture far better than burlap. A polypropylene bag filled with coarse gravel or heavy sand will hold up through repeated handling, rough terrain, and extended outdoor exposure without the fabric degrading.

Burlap, by contrast, begins to weaken as soon as it's exposed to moisture — which is unavoidable in flood applications. The fibers swell when wet and can start breaking down within weeks of continuous submersion. Physically moving or stacking burlap sandbags after a flood often results in tears and bag failures that polypropylene bags would have survived.

**Winner: Polypropylene**

---

### UV Resistance

Neither material excels here, but **polypropylene standard-grade bags will fail faster in direct sun than most people expect.** Standard (non-UV-stabilized) polypropylene degrades and becomes brittle within 2–4 months of continuous sun exposure. UV-stabilized polypropylene bags extend this significantly — often 12–24 months — but cost more.

Burlap's jute fibers also degrade under UV, and arguably more predictably — you can see and feel the weakening before it fails catastrophically. However, burlap exposed to sun and heat dries out quickly, which accelerates fiber breakdown. For any long-term outdoor installation, neither standard-grade material is ideal.

**Winner: UV-Stabilized Polypropylene (tie for standard grades)**

---

### Cost

**Polypropylene sandbags are less expensive per unit**, typically running 15–30% cheaper than comparable burlap bags at volume pricing. For large-scale flood events where thousands of bags are needed, that cost differential adds up quickly.

Typical pricing (unfilled, per bag):
- Standard polypropylene: $0.20–$0.45 per bag
- UV-stabilized polypropylene: $0.35–$0.70 per bag
- Burlap: $0.45–$0.90 per bag

At the retail level (small quantities at hardware stores), the price gap narrows, but polypropylene remains the more economical choice for most buyers.

**Winner: Polypropylene**

### Eco-Friendliness / Environmental Impact

**Burlap wins decisively on environmental impact.** Jute is a renewable crop that requires minimal pesticides and sequesters carbon during growth. Burlap bags decompose naturally in soil within 2–5 years, leaving no microplastic residue.

Polypropylene sandbags, when they degrade, break down into microplastics that persist in soil and water. Disposal requires treating the bags as plastic waste — they can't simply be buried or left in a drainage channel. In flood situations where hundreds or thousands of bags are used, the disposal challenge for polypropylene is significant.

Environmental regulations in some regions explicitly require biodegradable sandbags for certain applications — near waterways, wetlands, and agricultural land.

**Winner: Burlap**

---

### Flood Protection Performance

For short-term emergency flood barriers (1–7 days), **both materials perform comparably** when properly filled and stacked. The structural integrity of a flood barrier depends more on fill material, stacking method, and wall geometry than on whether the bag is polypropylene or burlap.

For longer deployments (2–8 weeks), polypropylene bags hold up better structurally. Burlap bags in sustained submersion begin losing fabric integrity around week 3–4 under heavy water pressure.

One advantage of burlap: the natural fibers absorb moisture and swell slightly around the fill material, creating a tighter seal between bags. This can reduce seepage better than polypropylene in some configurations.

**Winner: Polypropylene (long-term); Slight edge to Burlap (short-term sealing)**

## When to Use Polypropylene Sandbags

Choose polypropylene sandbags when:

**You need long-lasting protection.** For barriers that need to hold for weeks or through a prolonged weather event, polypropylene won't degrade under sustained water pressure the way burlap does.

**You're on a tight budget.** At scale — 500, 1,000, or 5,000 bags — the per-bag cost difference with burlap adds up to hundreds or thousands of dollars.

**You expect multiple uses.** Polypropylene bags that haven't been contaminated can be emptied, dried, and reused for future flood events. Burlap bags that have been wet-cycled multiple times typically aren't worth reusing.

**You're in an area without specific biodegradability requirements.** Most municipalities accept polypropylene sandbags for standard flood control use, and disposal via regular waste channels is generally permitted.

**Typical use cases:** Residential flood barriers, driveway and doorway protection, garage flood walls, temporary levee construction.

---

## When to Use Burlap Sandbags

Choose burlap sandbags when:

**Environmental compliance is required.** Near wetlands, rivers, streams, or protected land, many jurisdictions require biodegradable materials. Burlap is the standard compliant choice.

**You're building a permanent erosion barrier.** For slope stabilization or erosion control applications where bags will be covered with soil or vegetation, burlap is ideal — it decomposes in place without leaving plastic waste.

**Short-term flood protection is all you need.** If you need a barrier for a storm weekend and plan to remove it within a week, burlap performs just fine and disposal is simpler.

**Post-event cleanup matters.** After a flood, bags left behind can be left to naturally biodegrade if they're on your property and don't need to be hauled away.

**Typical use cases:** Erosion control near waterways, slope stabilization, temporary barriers where post-event burial/composting is planned, environmentally sensitive areas.

---

## Can You Mix Polypropylene and Burlap in the Same Barrier?

Yes — mixing materials in a flood barrier doesn't create a structural problem. Each bag functions independently, and the barrier's effectiveness depends on the fill, the stacking pattern, and the total mass.

That said, avoid mixing materials if you're trying to maintain consistent decomposition for planned in-ground barriers, or if local disposal regulations treat the two materials differently.

---

## What About UV-Stabilized Polypropylene?

If your application requires outdoor exposure beyond 3 months, UV-stabilized polypropylene bags are worth the premium. These bags are chemically treated during manufacturing to resist UV degradation. They typically last 12–24 months in direct sun versus 2–4 months for standard polypropylene.

UV-stabilized bags are often green or tan (the additives affect color), which also makes them easier to identify in inventory. For permanent or semi-permanent installations — bridge abutments, long-term levee support, construction site erosion barriers — UV-stabilized polypropylene is the correct choice.

---

## Which Material Is Right for You?

**Choose polypropylene if:** You need durability, cost efficiency, and plan to handle standard waste disposal. This is the right choice for most residential and commercial flood protection scenarios.

**Choose burlap if:** You're in an environmentally regulated zone, you want post-event natural decomposition, or the application is erosion control where bags will remain in the ground.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Are polypropylene sandbags waterproof?**  
The polypropylene bag fabric itself is water-resistant but not waterproof. Water can seep through the woven structure under sustained pressure. The fill material (compacted sand or soil) provides the primary water barrier.

**How long do burlap sandbags last outdoors?**  
In exposed, wet conditions, 3–6 months is typical before the fabric begins losing structural integrity. In dry, shaded storage, burlap bags can last 1–2 years before degrading noticeably.

**Do polypropylene sandbags need UV protection?**  
Standard polypropylene bags can start degrading in as little as 8–12 weeks of direct sun exposure. If your barrier will remain in place for more than 2 months outdoors, use UV-stabilized bags.

**Are burlap sandbags more expensive?**  
Yes — typically 30–50% more per bag than comparable polypropylene. The price premium reflects the cost of jute fiber versus synthetic plastic production.

**Can burlap sandbags be composted after use?**  
Burlap sandbags can be composted if they haven't been contaminated with sewage, chemicals, or flood debris. Clean bags filled with sand or soil can be cut open and the fabric composted; the fill material can be reused or spread on-site.
