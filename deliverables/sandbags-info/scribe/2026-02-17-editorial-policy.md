# Editorial Policy

Sandbags.info covers flood safety, emergency preparedness, and sandbag use — topics where inaccurate information can contribute to property damage or physical harm. This page explains how we produce content, what sources we rely on, and how we handle corrections and updates.

## Who Writes Our Content

All content on Sandbags.info is written by staff writers and freelance contributors with backgrounds in emergency preparedness, civil engineering, construction, or technical communications. Writers are required to cite primary sources for every factual claim and flag any claim that requires specialist verification before publication.

For pages covering YMYL-adjacent topics — including contaminated sandbag disposal, structural load limits, and flood safety practices — we require review by a subject-matter expert with relevant professional credentials before the page goes live.

## Primary Sources We Use

We rely on the following authoritative sources across our content library:

- **FEMA publications** — including the Homeowner's Guide to Retrofitting, Flood Insurance Rate Maps, and flood resilience technical bulletins
- **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** — sandbag construction standards, levee guidance, and emergency response technical manuals
- **State Emergency Management Agencies** — for state-specific distribution, disposal, and regulatory information
- **National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)** — flood damage statistics and risk data
- **Peer-reviewed civil engineering literature** — for content on material performance, structural behavior of sandbag barriers, and UV degradation of polypropylene
- **NOAA and National Weather Service** — for flood event data, seasonal patterns, and regional risk information

We do not cite Wikipedia as a primary source. We do not treat manufacturer marketing materials as authoritative references for technical claims.

## Fact-Checking Standards

Every factual claim in our content — including sandbag weight ranges, fill volume recommendations, UV degradation timelines, and disposal regulations — is verified against at least one primary source before publication. Claims sourced from secondary or aggregated sources are cross-referenced against original documents where possible.

Statistics are cited with their source and date. When government data or safety standards are updated, we update the corresponding content within 30 days of the change becoming public.

## Content Update Policy

Flood safety information and product standards evolve. We review all Phase 1 content (our highest-traffic pages) on a **quarterly basis**. Phase 2 and Phase 3 content is reviewed on a **semi-annual basis** or when triggered by:

- A significant update to FEMA guidelines or Army Corps standards
- A change in applicable state or federal law affecting sandbag use or disposal
- A reader-submitted correction that identifies a factual inaccuracy
- A significant change in product availability or industry standards

All updated pages carry a "Last Reviewed" date at the bottom of the article.

## How We Handle Corrections

If you believe a page on Sandbags.info contains a factual error, outdated data, or a broken source link:

1. Submit the correction via our [contact page](/contact/)
2. Include the specific URL, the claim you believe is inaccurate, and your suggested correction with a supporting source if available
3. Our editorial team reviews all correction requests within 5 business days
4. Verified corrections are applied within 72 hours of confirmation

We publish significant corrections as an inline note on the affected page, including what changed and when.

## Commercial Disclosures

Sandbags.info generates revenue through lead generation forms for sandbag delivery and filling services, and through display advertising. We do not earn affiliate commissions on product recommendations, and no advertiser or lead partner has any influence over the editorial content of this site.

Our buying guides, comparison articles, and product-type pages are produced under the same editorial standards as all other content. Products and services are evaluated based on published specifications, independent testing data, and user-reported information — not on commercial relationships.

## Questions About Our Standards
