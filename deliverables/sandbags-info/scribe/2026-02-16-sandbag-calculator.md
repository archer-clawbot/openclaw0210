## Sandbag Calculator: Estimating How Many Bags You Need

Ordering too few sandbags in a flood emergency means a barrier that doesn't hold. Ordering too many wastes money and creates a disposal problem. Getting the estimate right before you order is worth a few minutes of math.

This page gives you the formulas, worked examples, and a framework to calculate sandbag quantities for the most common applications.

## The Basic Formula

The number of sandbags needed depends on the volume of the barrier you're building. Standard sandbags (14" × 26", filled half-full) stack to approximately **0.5 feet high × 1.5 feet wide × 1.5 feet long** per bag when laid flat in a pyramid-style wall.

**General formula:**

> **Bags needed = (Wall Length × Wall Height × 1.5) ÷ 0.5**

Or simplified: **Bags ≈ Wall Length (ft) × Wall Height (ft) × 3**

This accounts for the standard pyramid taper of a properly stacked sandbag wall (wider at the base, narrower at the top), which is the structurally correct way to build a flood barrier.

For more on proper stacking technique, see our [how to stack sandbags guide](/how-to-stack-sandbags/).

## Worked Examples

### Example 1: Flood Wall Along a Building (20 ft × 2 ft high)

A flood wall protecting the side of a building, 20 feet long and 2 feet high.

**Calculation:**
- Length: 20 ft
- Height: 2 ft
- Bags = 20 × 2 × 3 = **120 bags**

At 40 lbs per filled bag: ~4,800 lbs of sand fill needed.

---

### Example 2: Single Doorway Barrier (3 ft × 2 ft high)

A barrier across a standard doorway (approximately 3 feet wide) to a height of 2 feet.

**Calculation:**
- Length: 3 ft
- Height: 2 ft
- Bags = 3 × 2 × 3 = **18 bags** (round up to 25 to account for corner overlap and side spillage)

Standard planning figure: **25 bags per standard doorway barrier at 2 ft height.**

---

### Example 3: Garage Door Barrier (16 ft × 2 ft high)

A barrier across a double garage door opening.

**Calculation:**
- Length: 16 ft
- Height: 2 ft
- Bags = 16 × 2 × 3 = **96 bags**

Practical note: Garage door openings require careful sealing at the sides and bottom. Add 15–20% more bags to account for corner construction and seal-filling.

**Adjusted estimate: ~115 bags**

---

### Example 4: Full Residential Perimeter (100 ft × 1 ft high)

A low barrier ringing a house with a 100-foot perimeter, 1 foot high.

**Calculation:**
- Length: 100 ft
- Height: 1 ft
- Bags = 100 × 1 × 3 = **300 bags**

For a 2-foot-high perimeter wall: 600 bags. For 3 feet: 900 bags.

---

### Example 5: Emergency Levee Section (50 ft × 3 ft high)

A temporary levee section protecting a low-lying road or property boundary.

**Calculation:**
- Length: 50 ft
- Height: 3 ft
- Bags = 50 × 3 × 3 = **450 bags**

At this scale, consider pre-filled bag delivery — filling 450 bags manually is approximately 4–6 hours of hard labor for a team of 4. See our [sandbag filling service](/sandbag-filling-service/) for large-scale orders.

## Quick Reference Table

| Wall Length | 1 ft High | 2 ft High | 3 ft High |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 ft | ~15 bags | ~30 bags | ~45 bags |
| 10 ft | ~30 bags | ~60 bags | ~90 bags |
| 20 ft | ~60 bags | ~120 bags | ~180 bags |
| 50 ft | ~150 bags | ~300 bags | ~450 bags |
| 100 ft | ~300 bags | ~600 bags | ~900 bags |
| 200 ft | ~600 bags | ~1,200 bags | ~1,800 bags |

*All estimates based on standard 14" × 26" bags using pyramid-taper stacking method.*

## Factors That Affect Your Estimate

**Stacking method:** A vertical stack uses fewer bags per linear foot but is structurally weaker. A pyramid configuration (2:1 base-to-height ratio) uses more bags but withstands water pressure far better. Always plan for the pyramid method.

**Fill level:** Bags filled to ½ full stack better and create tighter seals, but they also mean each bag covers slightly less volume than a fully packed bag. The formulas above assume half-full standard bags.

**Terrain irregularities:** Uneven ground, sloped surfaces, and corners all require additional bags. Add 10–15% to your estimate as a buffer for irregular terrain.

**Water pressure height:** A barrier holding back 2 feet of standing water experiences significantly more lateral pressure than a 2-foot barrier holding back 6 inches. For high-pressure applications (deep standing water), increase base width — plan 3 bags wide at the base for every 1 foot of finished wall height.

**Sealing requirements:** Gaps at the bottom of barriers (against walls, around pipes, at door thresholds) require additional bags stuffed into irregular spaces. Budget a 10–20% quantity buffer for sealing work.

## How Much Fill (Sand) Do You Need?

Each standard bag requires approximately **0.5 cubic feet of sand fill** when filled to the half-full mark.

**Formula:** Cubic feet of sand = Number of bags × 0.5

**Example:** 120 bags × 0.5 ft³ = 60 cubic feet of sand

Sand is typically sold in cubic yards: 1 cubic yard = 27 cubic feet.

**Example:** 60 ft³ ÷ 27 = **2.2 cubic yards of sand** for 120 bags.

| Bags Needed | Sand Required (ft³) | Sand Required (yards) |
|---|---|---|
| 25 bags | 12.5 ft³ | ~0.5 yd³ |
| 50 bags | 25 ft³ | ~1 yd³ |
| 120 bags | 60 ft³ | ~2.2 yd³ |
| 300 bags | 150 ft³ | ~5.6 yd³ |
| 500 bags | 250 ft³ | ~9.3 yd³ |
| 1,000 bags | 500 ft³ | ~18.5 yd³ |

## When to Order Extra

Standard guidance is to order 15–20% more bags than your calculation indicates. Reasons to add buffer:

- Bags that tear or fail during filling
- Irregular ground that requires extra bags to seal
- Unexpected wall extensions if flood depth exceeds forecast
- Bags needed to protect secondary entry points (basement windows, utility penetrations, HVAC inlets)

For large flood events, municipalities often run out of available sandbags quickly. Ordering early — before the storm — is strongly recommended. Visit our [sandbags for flooding](/sandbags-for-flooding/) guide for timing and sourcing recommendations.
