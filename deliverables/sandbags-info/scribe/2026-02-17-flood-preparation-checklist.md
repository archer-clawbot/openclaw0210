# Flood Preparation Checklist: 30 Steps to Protect Your Home and Family

Flood preparedness isn't built in an hour — it's built over weeks and seasons before a warning ever sounds. This 30-point checklist covers everything from structural improvements to emergency supplies, insurance review to sandbag stockpiling. Work through it methodically and you'll be genuinely ready when the next flood threat arrives.

## Section 1: Know Your Risk (Items 1–5)

### ☐ 1. Determine Your Flood Zone

Visit FEMA's Flood Map Service Center (msc.fema.gov) and look up your property's flood zone designation. Zones labeled with "A" or "V" are Special Flood Hazard Areas — the highest-risk categories. Knowing your zone determines your insurance requirements, building restrictions, and urgency of preparation.

### ☐ 2. Learn Your Community's Flood History

Talk to longtime neighbors, your local emergency management office, or the county recorder. Historical flood data tells you what water levels to plan for, which routes typically flood first, and how much warning time past events have provided.

### ☐ 3. Register for Local Emergency Alerts

Sign up for your county's emergency notification system (usually Wireless Emergency Alerts supplemented by local systems like Nixle or Everbridge). Know how flood watches, warnings, and evacuation orders are communicated in your area.

### ☐ 4. Identify Your Property's Vulnerable Entry Points

Walk your property perimeter and identify all points where floodwater could enter: doors, windows at or below grade, garage doors, utility penetrations, basement stairwells, window wells, and floor drains. This map becomes your sandbag deployment plan.

### ☐ 5. Measure the Difference Between Your Home's Finished Floor Elevation and Base Flood Elevation

Your Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is the predicted height of the 100-year flood at your location. If your floor sits below the BFE, you're at meaningful inundation risk and should prioritize active flood defenses over passive ones.

---

## Section 2: Structural Preparation (Items 6–11)

### ☐ 6. Install Check Valves on All Sewer Lines

Sewer backflow causes some of the most expensive and disgusting flood damage. Backwater valves (check valves) on your main sewer lateral prevent sewage from flowing back into your home when the municipal system is overwhelmed. Have a licensed plumber install them.

### ☐ 7. Elevate Critical Utilities

Electrical panels, HVAC systems, water heaters, and laundry equipment at or near grade level are vulnerable. Elevation requirements vary by flood zone, but even modest raises — 12 to 24 inches — can save these systems in most flood events.

### ☐ 8. Waterproof Your Basement

Apply elastomeric waterproof coatings to basement walls. Install a sump pump with a battery backup (mains power often fails during floods). Seal cracks in foundation walls with hydraulic cement or polyurethane caulk.

### ☐ 9. Extend and Redirect Downspouts

Downspouts should discharge at least 6 feet from the foundation. Consider underground extensions that route water to the street or a dry well. During heavy rain, poorly directed downspouts pour hundreds of gallons per hour against your foundation.

### ☐ 10. Grade Your Landscaping Away From the Foundation

Soil immediately around your home should slope away at a rate of at least 6 inches over 10 feet. Flat or reverse-graded soil channels water toward your foundation rather than away from it.

### ☐ 11. Clear Storm Drains and Gutters Seasonally

Blocked storm drains cause localized flooding that compounds flood risk. Before each wet season, clear all storm drains on your property and check that street-side drains in front of your home are clear. Clean gutters of leaves and debris.

---

## Section 3: Sandbag Readiness (Items 12–17)

### ☐ 12. Calculate How Many Sandbags You Need

Use the entry point map you created in Item 4. Count the linear feet of each opening and the height of protection needed. As a rough guide: a 10-foot door opening with 2-foot protection requires about 50 bags. A 20-foot perimeter wall at 3 feet requires 300–400 bags. Learn more about [how to calculate sandbag quantities](/sandbag-wall-calculator/).

### ☐ 13. Pre-Position an Emergency Sandbag Supply

Stock at minimum a one-day supply for your critical vulnerabilities. For most homes, this means 100–200 pre-filled or empty sandbags. [UV-resistant polypropylene sandbags](/uv-resistant-sandbags/) stored indoors can last 5+ years, making them a cost-effective long-term investment.

### ☐ 14. Know Your Nearest Sandbag Distribution Center

Locate your nearest public [sandbag distribution centers](/sandbag-distribution-centers/) — the city or county facility where free or low-cost sandbags are distributed during emergencies. Confirm hours, requirements (ID, vehicle size), and whether bags come pre-filled or empty. Distribution centers run out quickly in major events.

### ☐ 15. Store Sand or Identify a Sand Source

If you're storing empty bags, you need a sand source. A pile of clean builder's sand covered with a tarp can be stored on-site indefinitely. Know the address of your nearest sand and gravel supplier in case you need rapid resupply. Some municipalities and big-box stores also sell bagged sand.

### ☐ 16. Stock Sandbag Tools and Accessories

Pre-position the tools you'll need for rapid deployment:
- Round-point shovels (2 minimum)
- Work gloves (multiple pairs)
- 4-mil or 6-mil plastic sheeting (enough to cover all barriers)
- Stakes or weight to hold down sheeting
- Wheelbarrow or hand truck for moving filled bags

### ☐ 17. Practice Your Deployment Plan

Do a dry run. Time how long it takes your household to place 50 bags in your highest-priority location. Practice reveals gaps: missing tools, inadequate lighting, physical limitations that require additional help. Read the [emergency flood response guide](/emergency-flood-response-guide/) for proper stacking technique.

## Section 4: Emergency Supplies (Items 18–23)

### ☐ 18. Build a 72-Hour Emergency Kit

Your kit should contain at minimum:
- Water: 1 gallon per person per day for 3 days
- Food: Non-perishable items for 3 days
- Flashlights and extra batteries
- First aid kit and manual
- Medications (7-day supply)
- Whistle to signal for help
- Dust masks and plastic sheeting
- Moist towelettes, garbage bags, and plastic ties

### ☐ 19. Prepare a Waterproof Document Binder

Store copies of these documents in a waterproof container or bag:
- Government-issued IDs for all household members
- Insurance policies (home, auto, health, flood)
- Property deed and mortgage documents
- Bank account information
- Medical records and vaccination history
- Contact lists (family, doctors, insurance agents)

Consider storing digital copies in secure cloud storage as a backup.

### ☐ 20. Maintain Cash Reserves

Keep $200–$500 in small bills at home. ATMs go offline and card readers fail during power outages. Cash is the only reliable payment method in the first 24–72 hours after a major flood event.

### ☐ 21. Charge and Prepare Electronic Devices

Keep a portable battery bank charged at all times during flood season. Identify backup charging options: car chargers, solar chargers. Know that cellular networks become overloaded quickly — text messages get through when calls cannot.

### ☐ 22. Prepare a Vehicle Emergency Kit

Each vehicle should contain: jumper cables, emergency flares, first aid kit, warm blanket, emergency poncho, water, and snacks. Most importantly: keep your fuel tank above half-full during flood season. Gas stations run out quickly during evacuations.

### ☐ 23. Make Plans for Pets and Livestock

Many evacuation shelters don't accept pets. Identify pet-friendly hotels along your evacuation routes. For livestock, contact your county agricultural extension office for large animal evacuation resources. Never leave animals chained or enclosed — if you evacuate, take them or release them.

---

## Section 5: Insurance and Financial Readiness (Items 24–26)

### ☐ 24. Purchase Flood Insurance

Standard homeowner's insurance does NOT cover flood damage. Flood insurance is sold separately through NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) or private insurers. Critical facts:
- There is typically a **30-day waiting period** before flood coverage takes effect
- Don't wait for a flood watch to purchase it — it will be too late
- Renters can purchase contents-only flood insurance

### ☐ 25. Document Your Property and Belongings

Create a home inventory video. Walk through every room, open every drawer, record model numbers and estimated values. Store this video in cloud storage. Updated annually, this documentation can speed insurance claims significantly and prevent costly disputes.

### ☐ 26. Know Your Insurance Claims Process

Before disaster strikes, know: your policy number, your agent's contact information, whether your insurer has a mobile app for filing claims, and what documentation they'll require. Some insurers allow claim filing by phone or app immediately after an event.

---

## Section 6: Evacuation Planning (Items 27–30)

### ☐ 27. Plan Multiple Evacuation Routes

Map at least two evacuation routes from your home to your destination. Identify which roads in your area flood first and include alternates. Practice driving the routes. During an actual evacuation, your primary route may be blocked.

### ☐ 28. Designate an Out-of-Area Contact

Choose a contact outside your region who can serve as a communication hub for your family. In localized disasters, it's often easier to call out-of-state than across town. Ensure all family members have this contact's phone number memorized.

### ☐ 29. Identify Evacuation Destinations

Know your local emergency shelters. Also identify non-shelter options: hotels along your evacuation routes (booked well in advance during emergencies), family or friends outside the flood zone. Have a primary and backup option for each.

### ☐ 30. Review and Update Your Plan Annually

Flood preparedness is not a one-time task. Review this checklist every year — before flood season:
- Update contact information
- Replace expired supplies and medications
- Re-assess your flood risk if your neighborhood has changed
- Test your sump pump, generator, and battery backups
- Restock sandbag supply as needed based on [sandbag lifespan](/how-long-do-sandbags-last/)
