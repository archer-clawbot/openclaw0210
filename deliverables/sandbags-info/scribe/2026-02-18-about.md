# About Sandbags.info

Sandbags.info exists because flooding is one of the most common and costly natural disasters in the United States — and because the information people need to protect their homes and communities is often scattered, inconsistent, or written for engineers rather than the people on the ground filling bags.

This site is built to change that.

## Our Mission

Provide accurate, actionable flood protection information that helps people make better decisions before, during, and after flood events.

That means practical guides on how to fill and stack sandbags, honest comparisons of flood protection methods, clear guidance on local sandbag distribution resources, and content that reflects current standards from FEMA, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and civil engineering practice.

It also means not wasting your time. Flooding is a time-sensitive emergency. This site is designed so you can find what you need quickly, whether you're an experienced contractor setting up a flood barrier or a homeowner staring at an approaching weather system and wondering what to do.

## What We Cover

Sandbags.info covers the full range of sandbag and flood protection topics:

**Sandbag fundamentals** — types of bags, fill materials, standard sizes, how sandbags work, and how long they last.

**Construction and deployment** — step-by-step guides for filling sandbags, building walls, protecting specific openings (doors, garage doors, crawl spaces), and constructing levee-style barriers.

**Flood preparation** — pre-flood checklists, how to assess flood risk, when to act, and how to coordinate with local emergency management resources.

**Post-flood guidance** — sandbag disposal, contamination handling, storage for reuse, and post-event cleanup.

**Local resources** — state-by-state guides on where to get sandbags, county emergency management contacts, and sandbag distribution centers during active flood events.

**Alternatives and comparisons** — honest coverage of alternatives to traditional sandbags, including water-activated barriers, flood panels, AquaDam systems, and HESCO bastions.

## Who This Site Serves

**Homeowners** facing flood risk make up the majority of our readers. Whether you live in a FEMA-designated Special Flood Hazard Area or simply deal with recurring basement or garage flooding during heavy rain, the information here is written for you.

**Contractors and construction professionals** who regularly work with sandbags in erosion control, trench shoring, construction site management, and temporary flood protection use this site as a reference.

**Emergency responders and volunteers** — including fire departments, county emergency management personnel, and community disaster response teams — use these guides when training volunteers or establishing quick sandbag deployment protocols.

**Property managers and facility operators** responsible for commercial or multi-family properties in flood-prone areas reference this site when building emergency response plans.

## Editorial Standards

Every page on this site is written with accuracy and practicality as the primary goals.

**Research-based content.** Our guides are informed by FEMA flood guidance documents, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers sandbag construction standards, peer-reviewed civil engineering publications, and documented emergency management practices. We don't publish estimates or best-practices claims that can't be supported by authoritative sources.

**Regular updates.** Flood risk, emergency management practices, and available products change. Pages on this site are reviewed and updated on a regular schedule to reflect current guidance. You'll see when pages were last reviewed.

**No product bias.** Sandbags.info does not operate an affiliate program. Product mentions in our content are included for informational context only, not commercial benefit. Our goal is to give you an accurate picture of your options, not to steer you toward a purchase.

**Clarity over jargon.** Flood protection literature is full of technical terminology that serves engineers but frustrates everyone else. We translate technical guidance into plain language without sacrificing accuracy.

## How Information Is Sourced

The primary authoritative sources informing content on this site include:

- **FEMA** (Federal Emergency Management Agency) — flood preparation, disaster response, NFIP (National Flood Insurance Program) guidance
- **U.S. Army Corps of Engineers** — sandbag construction standards, levee guidance, flood control engineering
- **National Weather Service** — flood watch and warning classifications, event terminology
- **State emergency management agencies** — state-specific distribution and response guidance cited in state resource pages
- **Civil engineering standards** — earthwork and temporary barrier construction principles

Where specific guidance draws on a particular source document, that source is referenced in the page content.

## A Note on Limits

Sandbags are a valuable flood protection tool with real limitations. This site covers those limitations honestly.

Sandbags will not stop a major flood event. They are most effective against 6–24 inches of water intrusion in relatively stable conditions. They require physical labor, access to fill material, and lead time. In fast-moving floodwaters carrying debris, they are not a safe or reliable primary barrier.

The information on this site is intended to help you make informed decisions about flood preparedness. It is not a substitute for guidance from your local emergency management agency, FEMA flood maps, or professional engineering assessment when significant property or life safety is at stake.

If you're in an active flood emergency, follow instructions from your local emergency management officials first.
