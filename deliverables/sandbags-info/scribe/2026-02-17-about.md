# About Sandbags.info

Sandbags.info is a national flood safety resource built for homeowners, emergency managers, contractors, and anyone who needs accurate, actionable information before floodwater arrives. Every page on this site is written with one goal: give you what you need to protect property and people — fast.

## Our Editorial Mission

Flooding is one of the most destructive and widespread natural disasters in the United States. According to FEMA, floods affect more Americans than any other type of natural disaster, and even a single inch of floodwater can cause more than $25,000 in damage to a home. Sandbags remain the most widely available, cost-effective flood barrier tool in existence — and yet most people have never filled one, stacked one, or planned where to get them before a storm is already bearing down.

That's the gap we exist to close.

Sandbags.info publishes practical, technically accurate content on how to use sandbags effectively: how to fill and stack them, which types work for which situations, where to buy or receive them in bulk, and what to do after the water recedes. We cover the full lifecycle — preparation, deployment, storage, and disposal.

## What Makes This Resource Different

Most sandbag information online comes from one of two places: product sellers with a financial stake in what you buy, or government emergency management sites that haven't been updated since 2014. We're neither.

Sandbags.info is independently operated and does not sell sandbags or earn commissions on product recommendations. Our revenue comes from lead generation for delivery and filling services, and from display advertising. That structure keeps our editorial content free from product-promotion bias.

Every piece of content we publish is:

- **Researched against authoritative sources** — FEMA guidelines, Army Corps of Engineers technical manuals, state emergency management agency publications, and peer-reviewed civil engineering literature.
- **Written for practical application** — not just "sandbags work," but how many you need, how to place them, and what mistakes to avoid.
- **Reviewed and updated on a scheduled basis** — flood safety best practices evolve; our content does too.

## Who Runs This Site

Sandbags.info is operated by a team with backgrounds in emergency preparedness, civil infrastructure, and digital publishing. We consult subject-matter experts in flood mitigation and structural engineering when producing content on technical topics. Our [Editorial Policy](/editorial-policy/) describes our research and review standards in detail.

We are not affiliated with any government agency, and nothing on this site constitutes official emergency management advice. For immediate flood emergencies, contact your local emergency management office, FEMA, or call 911.

## Our Commitment to Accuracy

Flood safety is not a topic where errors are merely inconvenient — they can be dangerous. We take that responsibility seriously. If you believe any information on this site is inaccurate or outdated, we want to hear from you. Use our [contact page](/contact/) to send a correction request. Verified corrections are implemented within 72 hours of receipt.
