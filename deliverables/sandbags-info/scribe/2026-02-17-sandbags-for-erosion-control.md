# Sandbags for Erosion Control: Slope Stabilization, Stream Banks, and Construction Runoff

Erosion is a simple force problem: moving water lifts and carries soil particles. The faster the water, the more soil it carries. Sandbags for erosion control work by reducing water velocity, redirecting flow, and creating settling zones where suspended sediment drops out of the water column. They're deployed on slopes, along stream banks, at construction site drainage paths, and wherever concentrated runoff threatens to cut channels, undermine structures, or deposit sediment in protected areas.

This guide covers the major erosion control applications for sandbags, correct installation methods, sizing, and how sandbags compare to other erosion control BMPs.

## How Sandbags Control Erosion

Sandbags don't absorb erosion energy the way vegetation does — they intercept and redirect it. The three primary mechanisms:

**1. Flow velocity reduction.** A sandbag check dam across a drainage swale forces water to pool behind the dam, dropping its velocity. Slower water carries less sediment. The pool drains through or around the check dam at a controlled rate rather than rushing through at full velocity.

**2. Sediment trapping.** When water velocity drops behind a sandbag check dam or along a sandbag berm, suspended sediment settles out of the water column. This progressively fills the void behind the dam with trapped sediment, reducing the erosive potential of downstream flow.

**3. Flow concentration prevention.** Sandbag berms along contour lines on slopes prevent concentrated flow channels (rills) from forming. By spreading water across the full slope width rather than concentrating it in low points, sandbag berms reduce the per-unit-area erosive energy of runoff.

## Slope Stabilization

### Contour Sandbag Berms

On disturbed slopes at construction sites and graded land, contour sandbag berms placed across the slope face prevent rill erosion. Berms are placed on the contour (level) to intercept and spread runoff rather than concentrate it.

**Installation:**
- Space berms vertically at 25–50-foot intervals depending on slope gradient
- Steeper slopes require closer spacing (25 feet or less on slopes over 15%)
- Lay bags on the contour with their long axis parallel to the slope contour
- Overlap bag ends by at least 6 inches to prevent bypass flow at the bag joints
- Key the ends of each berm into the existing slope material (not left floating) to prevent end-run bypass

For slopes steeper than 30%, contour sandbag berms are supplemental to other measures (erosion control blankets, hydroseeding) rather than the primary treatment. Sandbags alone cannot hold soil in place on very steep slopes — they control runoff routing but don't anchor the soil itself.

### Protecting Newly Seeded Areas

After grading and seeding, bare soil is highly vulnerable to erosion during the vegetative establishment period (typically 3–8 weeks depending on species and conditions). Sandbag check dams in drainage paths downhill of newly seeded areas capture any eroded soil before it leaves the site, reducing off-site sediment transport while the vegetation establishes.

### Protecting Exposed Slopes During Construction

On slopes where grading will be paused (weekends, weather delays, phase breaks), temporary sandbag berms at the base of the slope catch sediment rather than allowing it to migrate to site perimeter and adjacent properties. This is a common interim measure between grading operations.

## Stream Bank Protection

Sandbags are used along eroding stream banks in several configurations. They're not a permanent stream bank restoration measure — that typically requires bioengineering with live stakes and dormant plantings — but they're effective as temporary protection and as structural support for vegetation establishment.

### Toe Protection

Lateral erosion of stream banks typically begins at the toe (the bottom of the bank where the bank meets the streambed). Sandbags placed at the bank toe prevent undercutting by protecting the base material from direct flow contact. Without toe protection, bank material above overhangs progressively slumps into the channel.

**Installation at bank toe:**
- Place bags at low water or during dry season when possible
- Stack 2–3 courses high at the bank toe, parallel to the channel
- Key the upstream end of the sandbag run into the existing bank material at least 3 feet
- Key the downstream end similarly to prevent flow from wrapping around the end of the sandbag run

### Energy Dissipation at Culvert Outlets

Culvert outlets concentrate flow and create a high-energy jet that quickly scours the streambed below the outlet. Sandbags placed at culvert outlets break up the jet and distribute the energy over a larger area.

**Arrangement:** Place bags in a horseshoe pattern around the outlet, leaving the center clear for flow passage. Bags on each side and downstream of the outlet absorb and redirect the flow laterally rather than allowing it to continue cutting a scour hole.

### Diversion Berms During Stream Bank Repair

When stream bank repair work requires working in or near the stream channel, temporary flow diversion berms made from sandbags redirect low flows around the work area, allowing dry conditions for erosion repair. This approach works for minor repairs in low-gradient streams with modest flow volumes.

## Construction Site Runoff Control

Construction sites disturb soil across large areas, creating highly erosive conditions. Sandbags are listed in most states' NPDES Construction General Permit best management practice (BMP) toolboxes.

### Check Dams in Drainage Swales

Temporary drainage swales on construction sites concentrate runoff from graded areas. Sandbag check dams across these swales reduce the velocity of concentrated flow and trap sediment before it reaches site perimeter or inlets.

**Installation:**
- Dig a shallow key (6–8 inches deep, full swale width) and press the bottom course of bags into it — this prevents scour under the check dam
- Stack bags 2–3 courses high in the center, with the ends of the dam keyed into the swale banks at least 12 inches
- Leave the center of the dam 6 inches lower than the bag height on each bank — this controls where water overtops and prevents end-run scour
- Provide a rock or gravel apron downstream of the spillway to absorb flow energy where water drops off the dam

### Inlet Protection

Catch basin inlets receive runoff from paved and unpaved areas. Sandbag inlet protection placed around the perimeter of the catch basin slows incoming flow, reducing the velocity of water entering the inlet and trapping sediment before it enters the storm drain system.

**Standard configuration:** Single ring of sandbags around three sides of the catch basin, leaving one side open for maintenance access. Bags should touch the curb or frame and each other with no gaps. Check after each rainfall event and remove accumulated sediment from the upstream side.

For more on construction site applications, see our guide to [sandbags for construction](/sandbags-for-construction/).

### Sediment Basins and Diversion Berms

For larger construction projects, sandbag berms along perimeter drainage paths create temporary diversion berms that redirect site runoff into sediment basins before it leaves the site. These perimeter berms are typically a secondary BMP supporting a sediment basin or trap — the sandbags slow and divert the flow while the basin provides the actual settling volume.

## Agricultural and Rangeland Applications

### Farm Road and Field Road Drainage

Unpaved farm roads concentrate runoff along their grades, creating erosive channels at road edges and creating sediment deposits where the road runoff discharges. Sandbag check dams across roadside ditches break up this concentration and allow sediment to settle near the road rather than at field edges or in streams.

### Protecting Irrigation Infrastructure

Irrigation furrows on sloped fields create concentrated flow paths. Where erosion threatens to cut furrows deeper or widen them, sandbag check structures slow flow velocity and allow furrow beds to stabilize between irrigations.

## Sizing and Spacing Reference

| Slope Gradient | Recommended Check Dam Spacing | Bags per Dam (10-ft wide swale) |
|---|---|---|
| 0–5% | 50 feet | 15–20 |
| 5–10% | 40 feet | 20–25 |
| 10–20% | 30 feet | 25–30 |
| 20–30% | 20 feet | 30–40 |

For contour berms on slopes:
- One bag every linear foot of berm length
- Add 20% for end-keying and irregular terrain adjustment

## Sandbag Erosion Control vs. Other BMPs

| BMP | Best Application | Limitations vs. Sandbags |
|---|---|---|
| Silt fence | Perimeter sediment capture | Fails in concentrated flow; stakes required |
| Straw wattles | Slope contouring, lightweight | Less stable in high-flow conditions |
| Rock check dam | Permanent or semi-permanent check dams | Requires rock import, not easily removed |
| Sandbag check dam | Temporary check dams, flexible repositioning | Requires manual labor to install/remove |
| Bioengineering | Long-term bank stabilization | Slow establishment, requires plant material |

Sandbags are most competitive where temporary installation, easy repositioning, and no specialized equipment are priorities.

## FAQ: Sandbags for Erosion Control

**Q: How do sandbags compare to silt fence for erosion control?**
A: Silt fence captures sediment from sheet flow across the fence face. It fails in concentrated flow — the flow simply goes around or under the fence. Sandbag check dams are better suited to concentrated flow in swales and ditches. Most construction sites need both: silt fence for perimeter sheet flow and sandbag check dams in internal drainage channels.

**Q: How long do sandbag check dams last before needing replacement?**
A: In typical construction site conditions, polypropylene sandbags in a check dam last 6–12 months before UV degradation and weathering reduce bag integrity. Inspect bags monthly and replace any showing signs of brittleness, seam failure, or significant filling material loss.

**Q: Can I use dirt-filled bags instead of sand for erosion control?**
A: Yes, with a caveat. On-site soil fill works for check dams and berms. However, if the fill material is already contaminated with sediment from construction operations, it may not meet regulatory requirements for clean fill in some stormwater permit contexts. Clean sand is preferred where compliance with SWPPP specifications is required.

**Q: What do I do with sandbags full of accumulated sediment after a project?**
A: Sediment-laden bags from construction sites may contain regulated pollutants if the site used fuel, concrete, or other materials. Consult your project's environmental manager before disposal. In many cases, bags can be emptied and sediment spread on non-sensitive areas, with bags disposed of as regular construction waste.

**Q: How do I install a sandbag check dam so it doesn't wash out in heavy rain?**
A: The critical detail is the key — press the bottom course of bags into a shallow trench dug across the swale bottom, and embed the ends of the dam into the swale banks. The center of the dam should be slightly lower than the ends to create a controlled spillway. Without these details, water finds a path around or under the dam and scours around it rapidly.
