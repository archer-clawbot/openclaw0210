# Sandbags in Georgia: Flood Prep and Distribution Guide

Georgia's flood risk is as geographically diverse as the state itself. Coastal Savannah and Brunswick face hurricane storm surge and tidal flooding. Augusta deals with Savannah River flooding that has twice inundated large portions of the city in recent decades. The Atlanta metro manages chronic flash flooding tied to its massive impervious urban surface. And communities in southwest Georgia — including Albany and Valdosta — sit in low, flat floodplains where slow-rise river flooding can persist for days.

No single flood profile describes Georgia. This guide covers the state's varied risk landscape, how to access sandbags through GEMA and county resources, and preparation guidance for the areas most affected.

## Georgia's Flood Risk

### Coastal Flooding: Savannah and Brunswick

Georgia's 100-mile Atlantic coastline runs from Tybee Island in the north to the Okefenokee Swamp near the Florida border. Coastal communities including Savannah, Tybee Island, Brunswick, and the Golden Isles (St. Simons Island, Jekyll Island, Sea Island) face overlapping flood threats:

**Hurricane storm surge** is the most extreme risk. A major hurricane tracking up the Georgia coast or making landfall in the Savannah area could push storm surge 10–20 feet above normal tide levels in low-lying coastal and estuarial areas. The broad, shallow coastal shelf along Georgia's coast creates conditions where surge can build significantly.

**Tidal flooding** is a day-to-day reality in many coastal Georgia communities. Savannah's historic district sits at low elevation; during king tide events and high-precipitation periods, streets in parts of the city regularly flood. The combination of sea level rise and subsidence is incrementally worsening this problem.

**Savannah River flooding** affects communities both at the coast and inland. The Savannah River, which forms the Georgia-South Carolina border, drains a large watershed and can experience significant flooding following major rainfall events — most notably in 2004, 2015, and 2022.

### Augusta and the Savannah River Interior

Augusta sits at the fall line along the Savannah River and has experienced some of the most significant urban flooding in Georgia's history. Major flood events in 1990 and 2004 inundated large areas of Augusta and North Augusta, with water levels reaching 40+ feet on the Augusta gauge.

The Savannah River's upper watershed — including Lake Hartwell and Lake Russell — provides some flood storage capacity, but major rainfall events across the Carolinas and northeast Georgia can still overwhelm the system. Augusta's flood risk is heightened by the flat, low-lying topography adjacent to the river.

### Atlanta Metro Flash Flooding

Metro Atlanta faces a different challenge: chronic flash flooding tied to one of the largest urban impervious surfaces in the Southeast. The Atlanta metro's 30-county, 6+ million person footprint has dramatically reduced natural water absorption. The result: intense thunderstorm events routinely produce rapid, dangerous flooding of roads, underpasses, and low-lying residential areas.

The Chattahoochee River — which runs along the northwest edge of metro Atlanta — and its tributaries (Nancy Creek, Peachtree Creek, Utoy Creek) are responsible for significant flooding in residential and commercial areas of Fulton, DeKalb, and Cobb counties.

### Southwest Georgia: Albany and the Flint River

Southwest Georgia's flat, low-lying terrain and the Flint River basin create conditions for extended, slow-rise flooding. Albany experienced catastrophic flooding during Tropical Storm Alberto in 1994 — one of the worst inland flooding disasters in Georgia history — and again during Hurricane Michael in 2018. The Flint River is one of the most flood-prone major rivers in the state.

## Where to Get Sandbags in Georgia

### GEMA — Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency

The Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency (GEMA/HS) coordinates the state's response to flood events and other emergencies. During activated disaster declarations, GEMA coordinates with county EMAs to support sandbag distribution, resource allocation, and community assistance.

**Contact GEMA:**
- Website: [gema.georgia.gov](https://gema.georgia.gov)
- Main line: (404) 635-7000
- Emergency Management Director's line: available on GEMA website
- During active events, GEMA's website and social media provide real-time situation updates

GEMA supports county-level operations — for sandbag distribution locations, your county emergency management agency is the primary contact.

### County Emergency Management Offices

Georgia's 159 counties each have emergency management offices responsible for local disaster response.

**Key contacts for high-risk areas:**

- **Chatham County** (Savannah): Chatham County Emergency Management — (912) 201-4500
- **Glynn County** (Brunswick, St. Simons): Glynn County EMA — (912) 554-7880
- **Richmond County** (Augusta): Richmond County EMA — (706) 821-2977
- **Dougherty County** (Albany): Dougherty County EMA — (229) 430-6400
- **Fulton County** (Atlanta): Fulton County Emergency Management — (404) 730-5600
- **DeKalb County**: DeKalb County Office of Emergency Management — (770) 492-6015

During flood events, call 211 Georgia for referrals to the nearest active sandbag distribution site.

### Municipal and Public Works Departments

Many Georgia cities maintain their own emergency supply programs separate from county operations. Savannah, Augusta, Albany, and Columbus have historically operated municipal sandbag distribution during local flood events. Contact your city's public works or emergency management department directly.

### Hardware and Farm Supply Stores

Standard sandbags are available at Home Depot, Lowe's, Tractor Supply, and independent hardware stores throughout Georgia. Coastal locations — particularly in Savannah and the Golden Isles — typically stock heavier quantities approaching and during hurricane season (June–November).

## Flood Preparation Tips for Georgia Residents

### Understand Your Specific Risk

Georgia's flood risks vary dramatically by location:
- **Coastal zones**: Focus on hurricane surge preparation, tidal flooding, and Savannah River events
- **Augusta area**: Savannah River rise — monitor USGS gauges and NWS flood stage forecasts
- **Atlanta metro**: Flash flooding from intense thunderstorms — know the low points in your area
- **Southwest Georgia**: Slow-rise river flooding with extended duration — prepare for multi-day events

### Check Your Flood Zone

FEMA's Flood Map Service Center ([msc.fema.gov](https://msc.fema.gov)) provides flood zone designations for every property in Georgia. Zone AE properties face the highest river and coastal flood risk. Zone VE coastal properties face additional wave hazard. Understanding your zone should inform your insurance coverage and preparation level.

### Pre-Season Preparation

Hurricane season (June 1–November 30) is the primary window for coastal preparedness. Spring flooding season (February–April) is most relevant for river-adjacent communities inland. Before these windows open:

- Stock 50–150 sandbags and an appropriate quantity of sand for your property's risk level
- Identify your county's emergency notification system and sign up for alerts
- Know your evacuation zone if you live in Chatham or Glynn County
- Locate your nearest FEMA flood distribution site at [sandbags.info/sandbag-distribution-centers/](/sandbag-distribution-centers/)

### Coastal Georgia: Evacuation Zone Awareness

Chatham County and Glynn County use evacuation zone systems for hurricane response. Chatham County uses zones 1–5 (with Zone 1 being highest risk), and Glynn County uses a similar tiered system. Know your zone before hurricane season begins — this determination, not the storm intensity forecast, should drive your evacuation decision.

Sandbags are appropriate for protecting property during voluntary preparation phases. They are not a substitute for evacuation when a mandatory evacuation order is issued for your zone.

## Key Flood-Prone Areas in Georgia

### Savannah

Georgia's oldest major city has extensive flood exposure from multiple sources. The historic downtown, Savannah Victorian District, and Southside neighborhoods see regular tidal and storm flooding. Chatham County's extensive marsh and estuarial system means that water from Gulf storms can affect the area even when direct landfalls occur further from the Georgia coast.

### Augusta

The Augusta metro's Savannah River flooding risk is well-documented. Low-lying areas of Augusta proper, including communities north of Broad Street near the riverfront and in North Augusta across the South Carolina border, face the highest exposure. Augusta's levee system provides some protection, but it is not engineered to handle the highest recorded flood events.

### Albany and the Golden Isles

Albany's repeated experience with major flood events — including near-record Flint River crests — gives the city's emergency management program extensive experience with large-scale sandbag deployment and response. The coastal Golden Isles (St. Simons Island, Jekyll Island, and surrounding communities) face surge and tidal flooding as their primary threat.

### Atlanta Metro

Flash flooding in metro Atlanta is a consistent, annual event. The I-285 corridor, Bankhead area, and numerous low-water crossing roads throughout Fulton, DeKalb, and Gwinnett counties are chronic flooding points. Peachtree Creek and Nancy Creek corridors have produced significant residential flooding in Buckhead, Brookhaven, and other communities.
