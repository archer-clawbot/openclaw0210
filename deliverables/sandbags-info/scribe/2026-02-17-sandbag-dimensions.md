# Sandbag Dimensions: Empty, Filled, and Everything In Between

Sandbag dimensions are one of those details that seem straightforward until you're standing in a hardware store trying to figure out why the bags you ordered won't stack the same way the ones from your county emergency office did. Understanding the exact measurements of sandbags — both empty and when filled — helps you plan barriers accurately, estimate quantities correctly, and choose the right bag for your application.

This guide breaks down sandbag dimensions across all standard sizes, explains how fill level changes effective dimensions, and shows you how to use dimensional data to plan effective flood barriers.

## Why Sandbag Dimensions Matter

Sandbag dimensions directly affect:

- **How many bags you need** to reach a specific barrier height
- **How much weight you'll be handling** per bag
- **How well bags stack** and conform to each other
- **How much storage space** empty bags require
- **Whether bags fit** in tight access areas (doorways, crawl spaces)

Sandbag dimensions are typically given in two states: **empty** (manufacturer's listed size, which determines the bag you order) and **filled** (actual in-use dimensions, which determine how the bag performs in a barrier).

## Standard Sandbag Dimensions: Empty

These are the most common bag sizes available in the United States:

| Bag Size (Empty) | Dimensions | Volume (Approximate) |
|---|---|---|
| Small | 12" × 24" | 2,880 cubic inches |
| Standard | 14" × 26" | 3,640 cubic inches |
| Large | 18" × 30" | 5,400 cubic inches |
| XL | 24" × 36" | 8,640 cubic inches |
| Industrial | 24" × 48" | 11,520 cubic inches |

The **14" × 26" standard size** accounts for the vast majority of sandbags used in residential flood protection across the US. For detailed discussion of why this size became the industry standard, see our [standard sandbag size guide](/standard-sandbag-size/).

## Filled Sandbag Dimensions: What to Expect

When a sandbag is properly filled (1/2 to 2/3 full), the dimensions change significantly from the listed empty size. The bag expands in width and height while the length shortens as fill material pushes outward.

### Standard 14" × 26" Bag — Filled Dimensions

| Fill Level | Approximate Filled Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| 1/3 full | 14" × 20" × 2.5" tall | ~18–20 lbs |
| 1/2 full (minimum recommended) | 14" × 18" × 3.5" tall | ~25–30 lbs |
| 2/3 full (optimal) | 14" × 17" × 4–5" tall | ~35–40 lbs |
| Full (not recommended) | 14" × 15" × 6–7" tall | ~55–60 lbs |

The 2/3-full fill level is optimal because:
- The bag remains flexible enough to conform to adjacent bags and surfaces
- Weight is manageable for single-person handling (35–40 lbs)
- The flat profile (4–5" tall) stacks efficiently without creating voids
- The tied or folded end can be tucked under cleanly

### 18" × 30" Bag — Filled Dimensions

| Fill Level | Approximate Filled Size | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| 1/2 full | 18" × 22" × 4" tall | ~40–50 lbs |
| 2/3 full (optimal) | 18" × 20" × 5–6" tall | ~55–65 lbs |

The larger 18"×30" bag creates a taller, wider course per layer — useful for large-scale levee construction where each bag counts more.

---

## How Bag Dimensions Affect Barrier Height

The height achieved per layer of sandbags is determined by the filled height of each bag. Using standard 14"×26" bags filled to 2/3:

| Layers | Approximate Barrier Height |
|---|---|
| 1 | 4–5 inches |
| 2 | 8–10 inches |
| 3 | 12–15 inches |
| 4 | 16–20 inches |
| 5 | 20–25 inches |
| 6 | 24–30 inches (~2 feet) |

These are approximate figures — actual height depends on tamping, bag fill consistency, and the weight of stacked layers compressing lower bags.

For a barrier that can hold back 18 inches of floodwater, plan for 5–6 layers of standard bags with appropriate base width. See our [how many sandbags for flood protection guide](/how-many-sandbags-for-flood/) for complete quantity calculations.

## How Bag Dimensions Affect Storage

Empty sandbags are lightweight and flat — storage is not a concern. A pack of 100 empty 14"×26" bags occupies approximately 1–2 cubic feet of space. Compare this to filled bags: 100 standard filled bags occupy roughly 35–40 cubic feet (about the size of two large refrigerators on their sides).

For homeowners who want to store flood protection supplies year-round:
- **Empty bags**: Extremely compact, store in a bin, cabinet, or closet
- **Filled bags**: Not practical for home storage — deploy only when needed
- **Self-inflating bags**: Flat-packed, similar storage footprint to empty traditional bags

If you want to keep flood protection ready without storing heavy filled bags, stock empty bags and arrange for a [sandbag filling service](/sandbag-filling-service/) to mobilize when a storm threatens.

## Choosing Bag Dimensions for Your Application

| Application | Recommended Size |
|---|---|
| Door and entryway protection | 14" × 26" (standard) |
| Garage door protection | 14" × 26" (standard) |
| Perimeter barrier under 3 feet | 14" × 26" (standard) |
| Perimeter barrier over 3 feet | 18" × 30" (large) |
| Levee construction | 18" × 30" or 24" × 36" |
| Erosion control | 14" × 26" or 18" × 30" |
| Tight spaces / crawl spaces | 12" × 24" (small) |

For most residential flood protection, the 14"×26" standard bag handles every application efficiently. Upgrade to 18"×30" only when you need to build a taller or wider barrier more efficiently with fewer bags.

### What are the dimensions of a filled sandbag?

A standard 14"x26" sandbag filled 2/3 full measures approximately 14 inches wide by 17–18 inches long by 4–5 inches tall when stacked. The exact dimensions vary with fill level and the weight of bags stacked on top.

### How tall is a sandbag when filled?

A properly filled standard sandbag (14"x26", filled 2/3 full) stands approximately 4–5 inches tall when placed flat. When compressed under the weight of stacked bags, height per layer in a multi-layer barrier is typically 3.5–4.5 inches.

### What is the difference between 14x26 and 18x30 sandbags?

The 14"x26" is the standard residential size — manageable for single-person handling at 35–40 lbs filled. The 18"x30" is a larger bag that weighs 55–65 lbs when filled and is used for levees and commercial applications where larger bag mass is more efficient.

### How many sandbags are in a pallet?

Empty sandbag pallets typically contain 500–2,000 bags depending on bag size and manufacturer. Filled sandbag pallets are typically limited to 20–50 bags due to weight constraints (a 50-bag pallet of standard filled bags weighs approximately 1,750–2,000 lbs).

### Does the fill material affect sandbag dimensions?

Yes. Coarser fill materials (gravel, coarse sand) create slightly different bag profiles than fine sand. Fine sand produces more uniform, conforming bags. Coarse materials may create a slightly stiffer bag that doesn't conform as well to adjacent bags, potentially leaving small gaps in a barrier.
