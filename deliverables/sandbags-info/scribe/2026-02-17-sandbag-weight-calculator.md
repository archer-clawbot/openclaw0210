# Sandbag Weight Calculator

Use this calculator to estimate the total weight of filled sandbags based on quantity, fill material, and bag size. Accurate weight estimates help you plan transport, coordinate volunteer or crew labor, and avoid overloading vehicles or storage structures.

## How Much Does a Filled Sandbag Weigh?

Sandbag weight depends on three variables: bag size, fill material, and how full the bag is. Standard guidance from FEMA and the Army Corps of Engineers recommends filling bags half to two-thirds full — this produces a bag that's heavy enough to stay in place and flexible enough to conform to the ground and adjacent bags.

### Weight by Bag Size and Fill Level (Sand Fill)

| Bag Size | Half Full | Two-Thirds Full | Full |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|------|
| 14"×26" (standard) | 25–30 lbs | 35–40 lbs | 50–55 lbs |
| 18"×30" (large) | 40–45 lbs | 55–65 lbs | 75–85 lbs |

*Weights based on construction sand fill (~100 lbs per cubic foot)*

### Weight by Fill Material (Standard 14"×26" Bag, Two-Thirds Full)

| Fill Material | Approx. Weight per Bag | Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| Construction sand (coarse) | 35–40 lbs | Standard; most commonly available |
| Fine sand | 38–42 lbs | Slightly denser than coarse |
| Moist soil | 30–38 lbs | Variable; depends heavily on moisture content and soil composition |
| Pea gravel | 40–50 lbs | Denser than sand; higher weight per bag |
| Dry soil/loam | 22–30 lbs | Not recommended — poor compaction, inconsistent barrier |

## Total Weight Reference Table

| Number of Bags | Weight at 35 lbs/bag | Weight at 40 lbs/bag |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| 50 | 1,750 lbs | 2,000 lbs |
| 100 | 3,500 lbs | 4,000 lbs |
| 250 | 8,750 lbs | 10,000 lbs |
| 500 | 17,500 lbs | 20,000 lbs |
| 1,000 | 35,000 lbs (17.5 tons) | 40,000 lbs (20 tons) |

## Why Fill Level Matters (Don't Fill Bags All the Way)

An overfilled sandbag is harder to handle, doesn't conform to the ground or adjacent bags, and creates gaps in the wall. The recommended fill level — half to two-thirds — is not about saving sand. It's about barrier performance.

A properly filled bag at two-thirds capacity:
- Weighs enough to resist displacement by water flow
- Has enough flexibility to compress and seal against adjacent bags
- Can be placed and adjusted by one person without equipment (35–40 lbs is manageable; a fully filled 55-lb bag is not)

For pre-filled sandbags delivered by a supplier, ask what fill level their bags are packed to. The best pre-filled options are specified at two-thirds fill.

## Planning Transport: Weight Considerations

Before ordering a large quantity of sandbags, verify that your transport can handle the load.

**Common vehicle payload capacities:**

| Vehicle Type | Typical Payload Capacity |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| Standard pickup truck (half-ton) | 1,000–1,500 lbs |
| Three-quarter ton pickup | 1,500–2,500 lbs |
| One-ton pickup | 2,000–3,500 lbs |
| 10-ft box truck (rental) | 3,000–5,000 lbs |
| 16-ft box truck | 5,000–8,000 lbs |
| Pallet jack + flatbed trailer | 10,000–20,000 lbs |

**Quick math example:** You need 300 standard sandbags (sand fill, two-thirds full). At 37 lbs per bag, that's approximately 11,100 lbs — about 5.5 tons. A standard half-ton pickup can't safely carry that in a single trip. You'd need 7–8 trips, a one-ton vehicle, or a delivery service.

This is why sandbag delivery services handling pallet and truckload quantities are common — the weight logistics for large orders exceed most personal vehicle capacity. See our [sandbag delivery services guide](/sandbag-delivery-services/) for options.

## Weight Calculations for Common Flood Scenarios

### Protect a Single Door Opening (3 ft wide, 3 rows high)
- Bags needed: approximately 30–40 bags
- Total weight (sand fill): 1,100–1,600 lbs
- Can be moved in: 1–2 pickup truck trips

### Protect a Standard Garage Door (16 ft wide, 4 rows high)
- Bags needed: approximately 120–160 bags
- Total weight: 4,400–6,400 lbs
- Requires a larger truck or delivery service

### Home Perimeter Barrier (150 linear feet, 2 ft high)
- Bags needed: approximately 2,200–2,800 bags
- Total weight: 77,000–110,000 lbs (35–50 tons)
- Requires pallet/truckload delivery; not a pickup truck job
