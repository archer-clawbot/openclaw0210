## Content

### Introduction

Walk into a hardware store looking for sandbags, and you'll face an unexpected decision: **burlap or polypropylene? Woven or non-woven? Empty or pre-filled? Tied or untied?**

The sandbag you choose has a direct impact on how well it performs, how long it lasts, and whether it's appropriate for your specific application. Using burlap sandbags for a year-long construction project leads to UV degradation and failure. Using expensive polypropylene bags for a one-week flood event wastes money.

This comprehensive guide breaks down **every type of sandbag** available: the materials they're made from, their strengths and weaknesses, ideal applications, cost comparisons, and how to choose the right bag for your needs.

Whether you're preparing for a flood, managing a construction site, building a military fortification, or organizing an outdoor event, understanding sandbag types ensures you get maximum protection and value.

## Sandbag Material Types: Overview

Sandbags are categorized primarily by **material composition**:

### Natural Fiber Sandbags
- **Burlap (hessian)**
- **Jute**
- **Cotton (rare, specialty use)**

**Characteristics:** Biodegradable, breathable, water-absorbent, UV-sensitive

### Synthetic Sandbags
- **Polypropylene (woven plastic)**
