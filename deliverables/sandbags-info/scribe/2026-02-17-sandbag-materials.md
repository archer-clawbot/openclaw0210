## H1: Sandbag Materials: What Sandbags Are Made Of and Why It Matters

Not all sandbags are built the same. The material determines how long a bag holds up in sun and water, whether it stretches or tears under weight, and how well it seals against fine sand particles washing through the weave. Choosing the wrong material — or using degraded bags — can cause barrier failure at exactly the wrong moment.

This page covers the main sandbag materials in common use, what each is best suited for, and how to evaluate bag quality before you fill them.

## H2: The Two Main Sandbag Materials

### H3: Woven Polypropylene — The Modern Standard

The overwhelming majority of sandbags used today are made from **woven polypropylene (PP)**. Polypropylene is a thermoplastic polymer that's extruded into flat tape-like strips and woven into a fabric. The result is a bag that's light before filling, strong after, and resistant to water, mold, and most chemicals.

**Key properties of woven polypropylene sandbags:**

- **Tensile strength:** High — a standard PP sandbag can hold 40–60 pounds without tearing at the seams
- **Water resistance:** PP doesn't absorb water; it remains dry and maintains strength when wet
- **Rot resistance:** Unlike burlap, PP won't decompose in weeks of moisture exposure
- **UV degradation:** Standard PP bags degrade in UV light over 4–8 months, becoming brittle and prone to splitting
- **Weight (empty):** 3–5 ounces per bag for standard 14"×26" or 14"×30" sizes

**Limitation:** Standard polypropylene bags are not UV-stabilized. Bags stored outdoors or used in extended barrier applications will begin cracking and splitting within a season. For permanent or seasonal applications, UV-stabilized PP bags are required.

### H3: UV-Stabilized Polypropylene — Extended-Life Option

UV-stabilized polypropylene bags contain chemical additives that absorb or reflect ultraviolet radiation, dramatically slowing photodegradation. Where standard PP bags may last 4–8 months in direct sun, UV-stabilized variants typically maintain integrity for 12–24 months or longer under similar exposure.

These bags are identifiable by their slightly different texture and often come in tan, green, or other colors (though color alone doesn't indicate UV stabilization — check the product specification). They cost approximately 20–40% more than standard PP bags and are the recommended choice for:

- Permanent or semi-permanent flood barrier installations
- Bags that will be stored outdoors between flood seasons
- Tropical or high-UV climates where degradation happens faster

### H3: Burlap — The Historical Standard

**Burlap** (woven jute fiber) was the original sandbag material and remained the global standard through World War II and into the 1950s. It's a natural fiber fabric with a loose, open weave that's breathable and biodegradable.

**Properties of burlap sandbags:**

- **Durability in water:** Poor — burlap rots within weeks to months of continuous moisture exposure
- **UV resistance:** Moderate — natural fibers don't photodegrade as quickly as plastics, but the bags weaken as they rot
- **Environmental profile:** Biodegradable — burlap bags can be left in place and will decompose, which is an advantage in some post-flood cleanup scenarios
- **Sand retention:** The open weave allows fine sand particles to escape, reducing the effective fill over time

Burlap sandbags are still sold and occasionally used where biodegradability is a priority (e.g., erosion control applications), but they are not recommended for flood barrier construction where durability is critical. The rot timeline is simply too short to make them reliable.

## H2: Bag Construction Details That Affect Performance

### H3: Seam Construction

A sandbag fails when its seam gives way under load, not when the fabric itself tears. Quality bags use either **heat-sealed seams** (fused fabric edges) or **sewn-and-overlocked seams** with industrial thread rated for the bag's load capacity.

Cheap bags often have single-stitched seams that unravel under stress. When evaluating bulk sandbags, pull the seam with moderate force before filling. A well-constructed seam will feel tight and uniform; a weak seam will start to gap or the thread will visibly stretch.

### H3: Bag Dimensions and Weave Density

Standard sandbag dimensions are approximately **14 inches × 26 inches** (unfilled). Some manufacturers use 14"×30" bags, which hold slightly more fill and are preferred for base-layer bags in tall barriers.

Weave density — measured in threads per inch — determines how well the bag retains fine fill material. A looser weave fills faster (better airflow through the fabric during filling) but allows more fine particles to migrate through over time. A tighter weave retains fine sand better but may be harder to fill with pneumatic equipment.

For most flood applications, a **10×10 weave** (10 threads per inch in each direction) is sufficient. Applications using fine fill material (silty sand or topsoil) benefit from a tighter **12×12 or 14×14 weave**.

### H3: Bag Weight Ratings

Manufacturers specify load capacity in pounds — typically 40–50 lbs for standard bags, up to 75 lbs for heavy-duty variants. For flood barriers, the relevant specification is not maximum load but **burst strength**: the pressure at which the fabric or seams fail.

Burst strength is tested by filling the bag to capacity and applying hydraulic pressure. A minimum burst strength of 200 psi is standard for FEMA-compliant flood control bags. Budget bags may meet this spec when new but degrade rapidly if stored improperly or exposed to UV light.

## H2: Specialty Sandbag Materials

### H3: Polypropylene with Internal Liner

Some manufacturers produce polypropylene bags with an internal polyethylene liner. The liner creates a secondary barrier that reduces seepage through the bag fabric, making these bags more effective when used to redirect water flow rather than simply slow it.

These bags are heavier and more expensive than standard PP bags but are the preferred choice for:
- Protecting building entry points where minimal seepage is critical
- Situations requiring barriers with a longer service life
- Applications where fine fill materials would otherwise migrate through standard weave

### H3: Water-Activated Self-Filling Bags

A distinct category, water-activated sandbags (sometimes called "quick sandbags" or "instant sandbags") contain a superabsorbent polymer that swells when water contacts it. These require no filling — place them flat, and incoming water causes them to expand to working size within minutes.

These bags are not a direct substitute for traditional sandbags:
- Per-unit cost is 10–30x higher than standard PP bags
- Expansion capacity limits their maximum size
- They're most useful for protecting individual entry points, not building large barriers

Water-activated bags are best used as a complement to traditional sandbags — covering doorway thresholds or sewer drains where deployment speed matters more than cost.

## H2: How to Evaluate Sandbag Quality Before Buying

**1. Check the UV rating.** Ask whether the bag is UV-stabilized. If the answer is "I don't know," assume it isn't. Standard bags have a very short outdoor service life.

**2. Inspect seam construction.** Heat-sealed or double-stitched seams outlast single-stitch seams significantly.

**3. Test the weave.** Hold the bag up to light — you should see a tight, regular weave pattern with no obvious gaps or irregularities.

**4. Look for a weight rating.** Reputable manufacturers specify rated load capacity. Bags without any specification are typically a lower quality tier.

**5. Check country of origin and compliance.** Bags used for federally funded flood response projects may need to meet specific standards. FEMA's Emergency Equipment List specifies minimum bag dimensions and material requirements.
