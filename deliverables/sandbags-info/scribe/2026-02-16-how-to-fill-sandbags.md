## Content

### Introduction

Filling sandbags seems straightforward: shovel sand into a bag. But **improper filling** leads to bags that burst, spill, won't stack properly, or provide inadequate flood protection.

The difference between an effective sandbag barrier and a failed one often comes down to **fill level, compaction, closure technique, and efficiency**. A properly filled sandbag is only **50-70% full**, has no air pockets, and conforms to irregular surfaces.

Whether you're preparing for a flood, building a construction barrier, or stockpiling for emergencies, this guide teaches you the **fastest, most effective technique** for filling sandbags—including what tools you need, the ideal fill level, common mistakes, and how to organize a team for mass production.

## Step-by-Step Filling Instructions

### Method 1: Solo Filling (One Person)

**Step 1: Position the Sandbag**

**With Sandbag Holder:**
- Place holder on stable ground
- Insert sandbag into frame, pulling top edges over holder rim
- Bag mouth should be fully open

**Without Holder:**
- Fold top 4-6 inches of bag outward (creates cuff)
- Place bag upright on ground, leaning against your leg
- Hold bag open with one hand

**Step 2: Shovel Fill Material**

- Scoop sand/soil with shovel
- Pour into bag opening (aim for center)
- **Fill to 50-70% capacity** (bag should be 1/3 to 1/2 full)
- **Critical:** Do NOT overfill (see [How Much to Fill](#how-much-to-fill))

**Step 3: Shake and Settle**

- Lift bag slightly and shake to settle contents
- Tap bottom of bag on ground to compact
- Eliminates air pockets and creates firm base

**Step 4: Fold or Tie Closed**

**Folded Closure (Standard Method):**
- Flatten the unfilled portion of the bag
- Fold flattened section lengthwise (like folding a paper bag)
- Tuck folded end **underneath** the bag when stacking

**Tied Closure (Drawstring Bags):**
- Pull drawstring tight
- Tie knot or secure with zip-tie

**Related:** [Sandbags with Ties vs Sewn-Top: Which to Use](/sandbags-with-ties/)

**Step 5: Set Aside for Deployment**

- Place filled bags in staging area
- Stack on pallets (off ground) if storing long-term
- Cover with tarp if storing outdoors

---

<a name="two-person-method"></a>
## Two-Person Team Method (Recommended)

**Efficiency:** **50-75% faster** than solo filling

### Roles

**Person 1: Holder**
- Holds sandbag open with both hands
- Positions bag for easy shoveling
- Shakes bag to settle contents

**Person 2: Filler**
- Shovels sand into bag
- Controls fill level
- Moves to next bag

### Process

1. **Holder** places sandbag on ground or over holder stand
2. **Holder** pulls top of bag open, creating wide mouth
3. **Filler** shovels sand into bag (3-5 scoops for 50% fill)
4. **Holder** shakes bag to settle, signals when full
5. **Holder** folds/ties bag closed while **Filler** moves to next bag
6. **Holder** moves filled bag to staging area, grabs new empty bag

**Timing:** Experienced teams fill **100 bags per hour** with this method.

<a name="assembly-line"></a>
## Assembly Line Method (Large-Scale Production)

**Best For:** Emergency situations requiring 500+ sandbags

### Team Roles (4-6 People)

**Station 1: Prep (1 person)**
- Opens new bags
- Places bags on holders or prepares for filling

**Station 2: Filling (2-3 people)**
- Shovel sand into bags
- Monitor fill levels

**Station 3: Closure (1 person)**
- Folds or ties bags closed
- Removes from holders

**Station 4: Transport (1 person)**
- Carries filled bags to staging area or deployment site
- Organizes stacks

### Setup

1. **Create sand pile** accessible from all sides
2. **Position sandbag holders** in a row (3-5 holders)
3. **Assign roles** and rotate every 30-60 minutes (prevents fatigue)
4. **Maintain rhythm:** Fillers work continuously while others support

**Efficiency:** A 6-person team can fill **200-300 bags per hour**.

<a name="how-much-to-fill"></a>
## How Much to Fill Each Bag

### The 50-70% Rule

**Correct Fill Level:** **1/3 to 1/2 full** (by volume)

**Why Not 100% Full?**

❌ **Overfilled bags (90-100%):**
- Rigid and inflexible
- Won't conform to surfaces (creates gaps)
- Difficult to stack in brick-laying pattern
- Prone to bursting when stacked

✅ **Properly filled bags (50-70%):**
- Pliable and moldable
- Conform tightly to ground and other bags
- Easy to stack and interlock
- Create tighter seal against water

### Visual Guide

**Standard 14" x 26" bag:**
- **50% fill:** Approximately **35-40 lbs** of sand
- **70% fill:** Approximately **45-50 lbs** of sand

**How to Check:** When laid flat, the bag should be **4-6 inches thick** (not fully round/plump).

**Related:** [How Much Sand to Put in a Sandbag](/how-much-sand-per-bag/)

<a name="fill-materials"></a>
## Best Fill Materials

### 1. Sand (Recommended)

**Pros:**
- Heaviest option (50 lbs per bag)
- Conforms well to surfaces
- Widely available

**Cons:**
- Can be expensive (if not free)
- Heavy to transport

**Cost:** Free at municipal distribution centers during emergencies, or $3-$8 per 50-lb bag at hardware stores

### 2. Soil/Dirt

**Pros:**
- Free (often available on-site)
- Readily accessible

**Cons:**
- Lighter than sand (35-40 lbs per bag)
- May contain rocks (can tear bags)
- Absorbs water (becomes heavier over time)

### 3. Gravel

**Pros:**
- Excellent drainage (water flows through)
- Heavier than soil

**Cons:**
- Sharp edges can puncture bags
- Doesn't conform as well as sand

**Best For:** Drainage applications, erosion control

### 4. Emergency Alternatives

- **Kitty litter** (absorbs water, expands)
- **Rice or grain** (lightweight, temporary)
- **Pea gravel** (smoother than standard gravel)

**Related:** [What to Use Instead of Sand: Gravel, Soil, Alternatives](/sand-alternatives-for-sandbags/)

### Weight Comparison (per bag)

| Material | Weight (50% fill) | Weight (70% fill) |
|---|---|---|
| **Sand** | 35-40 lbs | 45-50 lbs |
| **Soil** | 30-35 lbs | 40-45 lbs |
| **Gravel** | 40-45 lbs | 50-55 lbs |
| **Kitty Litter** | 20-25 lbs | 30-35 lbs |

<a name="closing-techniques"></a>
## Closing and Sealing Techniques

### Folded Closure (Most Common)

**Best For:** Open-top bags, temporary barriers

**Steps:**
1. Flatten unfilled portion of bag
2. Fold lengthwise (like rolling top of paper lunch bag)
3. When stacking, **place fold underneath** the bag (weight holds it shut)

**Pros:** Fast, no tools required, works with any bag  
**Cons:** Can spill if handled roughly before stacking

### Tied Closure

**Best For:** Drawstring bags, long-term storage, transport

**Steps:**
1. Pull drawstring tight
2. Tie overhand knot or use zip-tie

**Pros:** Secure seal, prevents spilling during transport  
**Cons:** Slightly slower, requires drawstring bags

### Sewn Closure

**Best For:** Commercial pre-filled bags

**Steps:**
1. Industrial sewing machine sews top shut

**Pros:** Permanent, professional  
**Cons:** Not reusable

<a name="common-mistakes"></a>
## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Overfilling Bags

**Problem:** Bags are too rigid to stack properly

**Solution:** Fill to **50-70% capacity** only

### Mistake #2: Not Shaking/Settling Contents

**Problem:** Air pockets create weak spots

**Solution:** Shake and tap bag after filling to compact

### Mistake #3: Using Torn or Damaged Bags

**Problem:** Bags split when lifted or stacked

**Solution:** Inspect bags before filling; discard damaged ones

### Mistake #4: Filling on Uneven Ground

**Problem:** Bags tip over, sand spills

**Solution:** Fill on flat, stable surface (plywood, concrete, compacted dirt)

### Mistake #5: Working Alone for Large Projects

**Problem:** Slow, exhausting, inefficient

**Solution:** Use two-person or assembly-line method for 50+ bags

### Mistake #6: Not Wearing Gloves

**Problem:** Blisters, cuts, splinters (especially with burlap)

**Solution:** Wear heavy-duty work gloves

## Tips for Faster Filling

### 1. Use a Sandbag Holder

**Speed increase:** 30-50% faster than hand-holding bags

**Options:**
- Commercial metal stands ($15-$40)
- DIY: 5-gallon bucket with bottom cut out (free)
- Improvised: traffic cone with top cut off

**Related:** [Best Tools for Filling Sandbags: Shovels, Holders, Funnels](/sandbag-filling-tools/)

### 2. Organize Your Sand Pile

- Create a **crescent-shaped pile** (allows multiple fillers to work simultaneously)
- Keep pile **waist-high** (reduces bending)
- Wet sand slightly (easier to shovel, doesn't blow away)

### 3. Pre-Position Empty Bags

- Open 10-20 bags at once
- Line up on holders or ground
- Reduces downtime between bags

### 4. Work in Teams

- **Solo:** 30-40 bags/hour
- **Two-person:** 60-100 bags/hour
- **Assembly line (6 people):** 200-300 bags/hour

### 5. Rotate Roles to Prevent Fatigue

Shoveling for hours causes exhaustion. Rotate every 30-60 minutes:
- Filler → Holder → Transport → Rest → Filler

### 6. Use a Flat-Blade Shovel

**Flat-blade shovels** scoop sand more efficiently than round-point shovels.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does it take to fill 100 sandbags?

**Solo:** 2.5-3 hours  
**Two-person team:** 60-90 minutes  
**Assembly line (6 people):** 20-30 minutes

### How much sand do I need for 100 sandbags?

Approximately **2 tons (4,000 lbs)** of sand for 100 bags filled to 50% capacity (40 lbs per bag).

**Calculation:** 100 bags × 40 lbs = 4,000 lbs = 2 tons

### Can I fill sandbags with dirt instead of sand?

Yes. Soil/dirt is a common alternative when sand is unavailable. However, dirt is **lighter** (30-40 lbs per bag vs 40-50 lbs for sand), so you may need additional bags.

**Related:** [What to Use Instead of Sand: Gravel, Soil, Alternatives](/sand-alternatives-for-sandbags/)

### Should I fill sandbags all the way to the top?

No. Fill sandbags to **50-70% capacity** (1/3 to 1/2 full). Overfilled bags are too rigid and won't stack properly.

**Related:** [How Much Sand to Put in a Sandbag](/how-much-sand-per-bag/)

### Do I need to tie sandbags closed?

Not always. **Folding the open end underneath** the bag (tucked closure) is sufficient for most flood barriers. Ties are helpful for long-term storage or transport.

**Related:** [Sandbags with Ties vs Sewn-Top: Which to Use](/sandbags-with-ties/)

### Where can I get free sand for sandbags?

During flood emergencies, many cities offer **free sand and sandbags** at distribution centers. Check your local emergency management website or call 311.

**Related:** [Where to Get Free Sandbags During an Emergency](/emergency-sandbag-locations/)

### Can I pre-fill sandbags and store them?

Yes, but with caveats:
- Store on **pallets** (off the ground)
- Cover with **tarps** (UV protection)
- Use **polypropylene bags** (last longer than burlap)
- Expect **6-12 month shelf life** for burlap, **1-3 years** for polypropylene
