# Burlap Sandbags: What They Are, How They Work, and When to Use Them

Burlap sandbags are one of the oldest and most recognizable tools in flood protection. The rough, woven fabric and earthy tan color are iconic — you've seen them stacked in front of homes during hurricane coverage, around river levees during spring floods, and outside businesses in coastal communities. But what exactly are burlap sandbags, and are they still the right choice for your flood preparedness needs?

This guide breaks down everything homeowners and emergency planners need to know about burlap sandbags, including their material properties, best use cases, limitations, and how they compare to modern alternatives.

## What Are Burlap Sandbags?

Burlap is a coarse, woven fabric made from jute plant fibers — a natural, plant-based material cultivated primarily in Bangladesh and India. When woven into a bag form, burlap creates a breathable, flexible, and relatively durable container capable of holding sand, gravel, or soil for flood protection purposes.

Burlap sandbags typically come in a standard size of approximately 14 inches by 26 inches when empty, and they weigh between 35 and 40 pounds when filled. The open weave of burlap allows some moisture to pass through and saturate the fill material, which actually improves stability — wet sand is denser and the bag conforms more naturally to adjacent bags and uneven surfaces.

## Key Properties of Burlap Sandbags

### Natural and Biodegradable

Burlap is a natural fiber. This is one of its defining characteristics and one of its biggest advantages from an environmental standpoint. Burlap sandbags left in soil will eventually decompose — typically within 1–5 years depending on soil conditions, moisture levels, and climate. This makes disposal simpler and more environmentally responsible compared to synthetic alternatives.

For applications where bags will be left in place long-term (such as erosion control on slopes or riverbanks), burlap's biodegradability can actually be an asset. The bag breaks down while the fill material remains in place, eventually stabilizing naturally with surrounding vegetation.

### Breathable Weave

The open weave of burlap allows water vapor and air to circulate. When burlap bags get wet, they dry over time — though they can mildew if stored damp in enclosed spaces. This breathability also means burlap is not fully waterproof. Floodwater will seep through burlap bags slowly, which is acceptable for short-duration flooding events where you're slowing water intrusion rather than stopping it completely.

### Texture and Grip

Burlap has excellent surface friction. Stacked bags grip each other and resist sliding, which improves the stability of a sandbag wall. This is a meaningful advantage compared to smoother synthetic fabrics, which can shift and slide if not carefully stacked.

### Strength and Durability

Burlap is reasonably strong for a natural fiber, but it is significantly less durable than woven polypropylene. Burlap will degrade when exposed to prolonged UV radiation from sunlight — typically showing significant breakdown within 3–6 months of outdoor exposure. Burlap also degrades faster in high-moisture environments, and bags stored wet will rot.

## How Long Do Burlap Sandbags Last?

The lifespan of a burlap sandbag depends heavily on storage and use conditions:

| Condition | Expected Lifespan |
|---|---|
| Stored dry, indoors, out of sunlight | 3–7 years (empty bag) |
| Deployed outdoors in shade | 6–12 months |
| Deployed outdoors in direct sunlight | 3–6 months |
| Deployed in flood water | 1–3 months before significant degradation |
| Buried in soil | 1–5 years before full decomposition |

If you need sandbags for long-term outdoor deployment, burlap is not the best choice. Polypropylene bags, which resist UV degradation and moisture, offer significantly longer outdoor lifespan. See our comparison of [woven vs. non-woven sandbags](/woven-vs-non-woven-sandbags/) and [polypropylene sandbags](/polypropylene-sandbags/) for more detail.

For seasonal or short-term use — including hurricane season preparation and one-time flood events — burlap sandbags are a fully functional and cost-effective option.

## Common Uses for Burlap Sandbags

### Flood Protection (Residential)

Burlap sandbags are effective for protecting doors, garages, and low-lying entry points from minor to moderate flooding. A standard doorway barrier using burlap bags performs similarly to polypropylene bags for short-duration events. The key limitation is UV and water degradation over time — if you set bags out weeks before an event and leave them exposed to sun and rain, the bags may weaken.

### Erosion Control

Burlap bags filled with soil or sand are commonly used to stabilize eroding slopes, stream banks, and hillside areas. Their biodegradability is an advantage here — the bags break down as vegetation establishes and takes over the stabilization function.

### Agricultural and Landscaping Uses

Because burlap is a food-safe, natural fiber, it's used in agricultural settings to wrap root balls, protect plants from frost, and line planting beds. While these aren't flood-related uses, they're relevant for homeowners who may repurpose bags after flood season.

### Military and Historical Applications

Burlap was the original sandbag material used by militaries worldwide. While modern military applications have largely shifted to polypropylene, burlap remains in use in certain contexts due to its availability and natural properties.

## Burlap vs. Polypropylene Sandbags: Key Differences

| Feature | Burlap | Polypropylene |
|---|---|---|
| Material | Natural jute fiber | Synthetic plastic |
| UV resistance | Poor (degrades in months) | Good (lasts years outdoors) |
| Biodegradable | Yes | No |
| Cost | Similar or slightly higher | Slightly lower at scale |
| Grip/friction | Excellent | Good |
| Moisture resistance | Low | High |
| Strength | Moderate | High |
| Lifespan (stored) | 3–7 years | 5–10+ years |

For most residential flood protection scenarios, polypropylene sandbags offer better long-term durability. But for single-season use, environmental concerns, or disposal-constrained situations, burlap sandbags are a legitimate and effective option.

## Buying Burlap Sandbags

Burlap sandbags are available through:

- Home improvement stores (Home Depot, Lowe's)
- Farm and ranch supply stores
- Emergency preparedness suppliers
- Online retailers (typically sold in bundles of 25, 50, or 100 bags)

When purchasing, verify the bag dimensions (14"x26" is standard), stitching quality (double-stitched seams are more durable), and whether bags are bleached or natural. Natural (undyed) burlap is generally preferable for environmental applications.

If you need bags filled and delivered, rather than managing the filling process yourself, a [sandbag delivery service](/sandbag-delivery/) is a practical alternative — especially if you're preparing for an imminent storm.

## Filling and Deploying Burlap Sandbags

The filling and stacking process is the same for burlap as for other sandbag types:

1. **Fill 1/2 to 2/3 full** — a fully filled bag is too rigid to conform and too heavy to handle safely
2. **Use clean sand or sandy soil** as fill material; avoid clay-heavy soil which can dry hard
3. **Fold or tie the open end** before placing
4. **Stack with the open end tucked under**, facing into the water source
5. **Tamp each layer down** before adding the next
6. **Stagger joints between layers**, like bricklaying, for maximum stability

For detailed stacking instructions and barrier layouts, see our guide on [temporary flood barriers](/temporary-flood-barriers/).

## Disposal of Burlap Sandbags After a Flood

Used burlap sandbags exposed to floodwater may contain contaminants and should be handled with care. Key disposal considerations:

- **If clean (not flood-exposed)**: Bags can often be reused or composted (burlap is compostable in most systems)
- **If flood-exposed**: Follow local hazardous waste or debris disposal guidelines
- **If left in place for erosion control**: Allow natural decomposition
- **Do not burn**: Even natural burlap can release particulates and potentially contaminated fill material when burned
