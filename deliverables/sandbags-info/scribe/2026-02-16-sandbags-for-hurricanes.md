### Introduction

Hurricane flood preparation is a race against a known deadline. Unlike surprise flash floods, hurricanes give you a window — but that window closes fast, and sandbag supply chains collapse as storms approach. Hardware stores sell out of sandbags 48–72 hours before a major hurricane makes landfall. Municipal distribution centers run out of bags within hours of opening.

This guide gives you a framework for hurricane sandbag preparation that doesn't depend on last-minute scrambling: a 72-hour prep timeline, quantity planning for a full house, placement priorities, and the honest answer to when sandbags are enough — and when they're not.

For the broader strategy on sandbags in flood events, read the [complete flood protection guide](/flood-protection/).

## Hurricane Sandbag Prep Timeline

The single most important thing about hurricane sandbag prep: **start 72 hours before projected landfall**, not 24 hours.

### 72 Hours Before Landfall

**This is your buying window.** Supply chains are still open. Stores still have sandbags. Municipal distribution centers haven't opened yet — but they will.

- Assess your home's flood vulnerability: identify all ground-level entry points (doors, garage doors, vents, window wells)
- Calculate how many sandbags you need — use the [sandbag calculator](/sandbag-calculator/) based on your home's perimeter and entry points
- Purchase or order sandbags (filled or unfilled) from suppliers or hardware stores
- Gather supplies: shovels, fill material (sand or soil), poly tarp, work gloves, boots
- Check your municipality's emergency management website for sandbag distribution center locations

**At 72 hours, storm track is still uncertain.** If you're in the cone of uncertainty, start buying. You can always store unused sandbags — you can't buy them once stores are sold out.

### 48 Hours Before Landfall

**Fill and stage.** If you purchased unfilled bags, this is the filling window.

- Fill sandbags (2/3 full) and stage them at entry points
- Begin building barriers at the most critical entry points (garage door, front door, back door)
- Cover any outdoor vents, dryer vents, or foundation openings with bags or plastic sheeting weighted down with bags
- Move vehicles, outdoor furniture, and valuables to higher ground or higher floors
- Check that gutters and downspouts are clear so roof water doesn't pool against the foundation

**If a municipal distribution center opens:** Send one person to get sandbags while others work on home prep. Expect long lines — bring the maximum quantity your vehicle can carry.

### 24 Hours Before Landfall

**Complete barriers and secure the property.**

- Finish all sandbag barriers — do not start new construction at this point, finish what's in progress
- Install interior secondary rows at all protected doors
- Shut off electricity to areas at risk of flooding (basement, garage)
- Fill sinks, tubs, and water containers — water service may be disrupted
- Final check: walk the perimeter of your home looking for any gaps in barriers
- Know your evacuation route and have bags packed

**If mandatory evacuation is ordered at any point, go.** No sandbag barrier is worth your life.

## How Many Sandbags for a Hurricane (By Scenario)

Hurricane flood impact varies enormously based on category, storm surge zone, distance from coast, and local drainage. These estimates reflect **direct flooding from storm surge and heavy rainfall pooling** — not from a levee breach, which requires professional emergency management response.

### Entry Points Only (Most Common Homeowner Approach)

Protecting doors, garage, and ground-level vents but not building a full perimeter:

| Home Size | Entry Points Protected | Bags Required (1-ft flood) | Bags Required (2-ft flood) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Small home (2 doors, 1 garage) | 3 entry points | 80–120 bags | 180–250 bags |
| Medium home (3 doors, 1 garage) | 4 entry points | 110–160 bags | 240–320 bags |
| Large home (4 doors, 2 garages) | 6 entry points | 160–230 bags | 360–480 bags |

### Full Perimeter Barrier

Building a continuous barrier around the home's foundation:

| Home Perimeter | Bags Required (2-ft barrier) | Bags Required (3-ft barrier) |
|---|---|---|
| 80 linear feet | 720 bags | 1,280 bags |
| 120 linear feet | 1,080 bags | 1,920 bags |
| 160 linear feet | 1,440 bags | 2,560 bags |

**Realistic assessment:** Full perimeter barriers require coordinated crews, significant fill material, and 6–12+ hours to build. For most individual homeowners, protecting entry points and vulnerable openings is achievable and significantly reduces flood damage. Full perimeter defense is more realistic for commercial properties and coordinated neighborhood efforts.

## Placement Priorities: Where to Put Sandbags First

When time or bag supply is limited, place sandbags in this priority order:

### Priority 1: Garage Door (Highest Volume Entry Point)

The garage door is the most common and highest-volume flood entry point in a home. A 16-foot double garage door has more linear opening than all your entry doors combined. Build the garage barrier first.

Minimum: 60–80 bags for a single-car garage, 100–140 bags for a double-car garage. See the full [garage door protection guide](/sandbag-garage-door/).

### Priority 2: Front and Back Entry Doors

Standard exterior doors. Build a 3-row pyramid barrier at each door, extending 6–8 inches beyond the door frame on each side.

Minimum: 15–25 bags per door. See: [How to Seal a Door with Sandbags](/sandbag-door-barrier/)

### Priority 3: Ground-Level Vents and Window Wells

Dryer vents, foundation vents, and basement window wells are flood pathways that homeowners routinely miss.

- **Dryer vents and exhaust vents**: Cover with a plastic bag secured with tape, then weight down with 1–2 sandbags
- **Foundation vents**: Block with sandbags or vent plugs
- **Window wells**: Build a 3-sided sandbag barrier around each window well, or use prefabricated window well covers weighted with sandbags

Minimum: 2–4 bags per vent, 8–15 bags per window well.

### Priority 4: Low Windows and Sliding Doors

Ground-level windows and sliding glass doors are vulnerable to both water pressure and debris impact.

- Sliding door tracks flood easily — place 4–6 bags in a row in front of the door frame
- For ground-floor windows in flood zones, sandbag the window well exterior and consider interior board-up

### Priority 5: Side Yard or Property Perimeter

If time and bags allow, extend protection to the property perimeter along the expected flood direction. This is worth doing only if you can complete a full continuous barrier — an incomplete perimeter leaves gaps that actively concentrate water toward your home.

## How to Stack Sandbags for Hurricane Flooding

Hurricane flood water arrives differently than slow riverine flooding — storm surge can come fast and with debris carried in the flow. Key technique adjustments for hurricane conditions:

**Build lower, wider, stronger:** Hurricane debris-laden water is harder on barriers than clean floodwater. Prioritize base width over height. A 2-foot-tall, very wide pyramid holds longer than a narrow 3-foot barrier.

**Double-layer the poly tarp:** In heavy rain and wind, a single tarp layer can be damaged. Use two overlapping layers of 6-mil poly on the waterward face.

**Weigh down tarp edges heavily:** Wind combined with water can lift unsecured tarp edges. Use double the bag count along the tarp base.

**Pre-fill bags less full than normal:** In high-velocity water, slightly less than 2/3-full bags conform better and fill gaps more effectively.

For full stacking technique, see: [How to Stack Sandbags](/how-to-stack-sandbags/)

## When Sandbags Aren't Enough: Evacuation Thresholds

This is the most important section of this guide. Sandbags protect against **moderate flooding** — they are not life-safety devices.

### Conditions Where Sandbags Are Not Enough

**Storm surge over 3–4 feet:** When storm surge forecasts exceed 3–4 feet, the volume and pressure of water overwhelms residential sandbag barriers. A Category 4–5 hurricane with predicted 8–12 foot storm surge is not a sandbag situation — it is an evacuation situation.

**Fast-moving water:** Sandbag barriers are not designed for high-velocity flow. Water moving faster than 2–3 mph begins to erode and undermine sandbag barriers. In storm surge conditions with rapid water rise, barriers fail faster than expected.

**Structural threat:** If your home is in a storm surge inundation zone designated as Zone A or Zone B, sandbags will not protect your home. These zones are mapped for evacuation, not sandbagging.

**Physical inability to complete barriers:** An incomplete sandbag barrier — one with gaps, short sections, or no poly sheeting — may channel water into your home more effectively than no barrier at all. If you cannot complete the barrier properly, prioritize evacuation.

### The Evacuation Decision Rule

**Follow mandatory evacuation orders without exception.** No property is worth a life.

For voluntary evacuation zones, the personal decision depends on: flood depth forecast, your physical ability to shelter in place safely (above water level), structural integrity of your home, and access to evacuation routes (which can flood before the storm hits).

When in doubt, leave. Sandbags protect property. They do not protect people.

## After the Hurricane: Sandbag Removal

Once the storm passes and water recedes:

- **Wait for standing water to fully drain** before removing barriers — residual hydrostatic pressure can cause water to rush in when barriers are removed
- **Wear protective gear** — floodwater (especially from hurricanes) contains sewage, chemicals, and debris
- **Check local disposal guidelines** — many municipalities set up sandbag collection sites after disasters
- Bags that were submerged in floodwater should be treated as potentially contaminated
- Clean, uncontaminated bags can be dried, inspected, and stored for future use
