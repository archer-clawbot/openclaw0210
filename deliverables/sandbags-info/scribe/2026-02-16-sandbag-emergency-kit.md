## H1: Sandbag Emergency Kit: What to Stockpile Before Flood Season

The difference between a flooded home and a dry one often comes down to preparation made weeks before the storm. Scrambling for sandbags 6 hours before a flood watch turns into a warning is the wrong time to discover your county's distribution site ran out — or that the hardware store sold out three days ago.

A pre-built sandbag emergency kit means you can act immediately when the forecast turns bad. This guide covers exactly what to stockpile, how much, where to store it, and what to include beyond the sandbags themselves.

## H2: Why Pre-Season Preparation Beats Emergency Sourcing

Emergency sandbag distribution points — county sites, hardware stores, fire stations — are reliable under normal circumstances. During an active flood watch affecting a large area, supply runs thin fast.

During Hurricane Harvey in 2017, home improvement stores across the Houston area sold out of sandbags within 24 hours of the first flood watches. During the 2023 California atmospheric river events, county sandbag distribution sites ran out within hours in multiple counties.

Pre-staging your own supply eliminates this risk entirely. Unfilled bags cost $0.50–$1.50 each and store flat for years. A proper stockpile that covers your home costs less than a single evening's restaurant bill and takes about 30 minutes to build.

## H2: How Many Sandbags Do You Need?

The quantity depends on what you're protecting. Here's a framework:

### H3: Protecting Doorways and Entry Points

A standard 3-foot-wide doorway protected to 24 inches requires approximately 30–40 sandbags stacked in a pyramid formation. See the full methodology in our [how many sandbags do you need guide](/how-many-sandbags-for-flood/).

For each exterior door:
- Standard exterior door (3 ft wide, 2 ft high protection): ~35 sandbags
- French doors or wide entries (5–6 ft wide): ~55–65 sandbags

### H3: Protecting a Garage

A standard single-car garage opening (8 ft wide) protected to 18 inches requires approximately 60–80 sandbags. A double-car garage (16 ft) requires 120–160 sandbags. See our [sandbag garage door guide](/sandbag-garage-door/) for installation technique.

### H3: Recommended Stockpile by Home Size

| Home Type | Exterior Doors | Garage | Perimeter Notes | Recommended Stockpile |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Apartment/condo (1 entry) | 1 door | None | Entry only | 50 bags |
| Small home, no garage | 2 doors | — | Basic perimeter | 150 bags |
| Medium home, 1-car garage | 2 doors | 1 bay | Standard | 350 bags |
| Medium home, 2-car garage | 3 doors | 2 bays | Standard | 500 bags |
| Large home, flood-prone lot | 3+ doors | 2–3 bays | + perimeter | 750–1,000 bags |

These quantities assume doorway and garage protection plus a small perimeter buffer. Properties in low-lying areas, near water, or in designated flood zones should add 20–30% to these estimates.

## H2: What to Include in Your Sandbag Emergency Kit

Sandbags alone don't protect you — you need the gear to deploy them correctly.

### H3: The Sandbags Themselves

**Woven polypropylene bags** are the standard. They come in two common sizes:
- **Standard (14" × 26")** — holds approximately 50 lbs of sand when filled; most common
- **Large (18" × 30")** — holds approximately 75 lbs; better for perimeter walls

For pre-season stockpiles, **unfilled bags** are the most practical choice. They store flat, weigh almost nothing, and don't degrade in dry storage. Plan to source and fill sand locally when needed — or use [our sandbag filling service](/sandbag-filling-service/) to have pre-filled bags ready before the event.

Pre-filled sandbags are also available for delivery — [our sandbag delivery service](/sandbag-delivery/) can deliver to your property, eliminating the filling step entirely.

### H3: Filling Equipment

If you're maintaining a supply of unfilled bags:
- **Square-nose shovel** — essential for filling bags efficiently. A round-nose shovel is slower.
- **Sandbag filler stand** — a simple frame that holds the bag open while you shovel. Speeds filling by 30–50%. Available at most farm supply stores for under $30.
- **Sand source** — keep 1–2 tons of coarse sand in a covered pile on your property if your lot allows, or identify your nearest landscape supply yard. Know their hours and whether they're open during emergencies.

### H3: Protective Equipment

Keep this staged with your sandbag supply so you're not searching for it during an emergency:
- Heavy-duty rubber or nitrile gloves (2 pairs per person)
- Safety glasses or goggles
- Waterproof boots
- N95 respirators (2 per person — useful during both filling and post-flood removal)
- Disposable Tyvek suits (2 per person)

### H3: Plastic Sheeting

6-mil polyethylene sheeting dramatically improves sandbag wall effectiveness. Lay it as an underliner beneath your sandbag rows to create a near-impermeable base, then fold it up the face of the wall. A single roll (10 ft × 25 ft, approximately $15) can significantly reduce seepage through a standard doorway or section of perimeter.

### H3: Supplementary Barriers

For doorways and entry points, supplement your sandbag supply with:
- **Self-inflating flood bags** (1–2 per door) — for rapid deployment if you run short on time
- **Rubber door sweep** — prevents water infiltration under doors independent of sandbag placement

### H3: Documentation and Communication

- Laminated quick-reference card: stacking technique, contact numbers for local emergency management
- Printed copy of your municipality's sandbag distribution sites and disposal rules
- Battery-powered weather radio (don't rely on phone signal during major storm events)

## H2: Storage Checklist

A sandbag kit that's unavailable when needed is no kit at all.

**Storage location requirements:**
- Dry, covered area (garage, shed, covered porch)
- Accessible within 5 minutes — not buried behind seasonal items
- Protected from direct UV exposure (degrades polypropylene bags within months)
- Temperature-stable — avoid locations that freeze in winter (affects filled bags)
- Off the ground on pallets or shelving — protects against minor flooding in the storage area

**Packaging for unfilled bags:**
- Original manufacturer packaging is fine if sealed
- Reseal opened bags with zip ties or tape to prevent moisture intrusion
- Label with date received — rotate bags older than 5 years to the front

See our complete guide to [how to store sandbags](/how-to-store-sandbags/) for detailed long-term storage instructions and our [sandbag shelf life guide](/sandbag-shelf-life/) to understand how long different bag types last.

## H2: Pre-Season Preparation Timeline

**90 days before flood season:**
- Assess your property for flood entry points
- Calculate your needed bag quantity using the table above
- Order or source unfilled bags
- Stock up on filling equipment and PPE

**30 days before flood season:**
- Confirm bags are in good condition
- Verify your sand source is accessible and available
- Check and replenish PPE supplies
- Review your local emergency management procedures

**When a flood watch is issued:**
- Fill bags if not pre-filled (or call for [sandbag delivery](/sandbag-delivery/))
- Stage bags near deployment points
- Stage plastic sheeting and filling equipment
- Monitor local emergency management communications

**When a flood warning is issued:**
- Deploy immediately — don't wait for visual confirmation of rising water
- Deploy in order of priority: garage first (largest opening), then entry doors, then perimeter
