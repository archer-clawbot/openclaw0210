### Introduction

A sandbag levee is one of the most effective temporary flood barriers you can build. When a rising river, stormwater, or overland flooding threatens your property, a properly constructed levee redirects water away from structures, buys time for evacuation, and can protect entire neighborhoods when built at scale.

But a sandbag levee built wrong fails fast — and often at the worst possible moment. Understanding the correct construction sequence, base width, staggered stacking, and gap-sealing techniques is the difference between a barrier that holds for 72 hours and one that collapses in the first hour.

This guide covers everything you need to build a functional sandbag levee: materials, site preparation, step-by-step construction, how to seal gaps, and realistic expectations for how long sandbag levees hold under different water depths.

## What Is a Sandbag Levee?

A sandbag levee is a temporary earthwork-style barrier built from stacked sandbags, designed to redirect or contain floodwaters over a distance. Unlike a door barrier (which protects a single opening), a levee runs along a perimeter — a yard boundary, a field edge, a street, or along a waterway bank.

Sandbag levees are used by:
- **Homeowners** protecting yards and foundations during riverine flooding
- **Emergency responders** redirecting stormwater from neighborhoods
- **Farmers and landowners** protecting crops or structures during seasonal floods
- **Municipal crews** reinforcing weak points in permanent flood infrastructure

A levee functions by creating a raised earthen wall that floodwater cannot easily overtop. The key engineering principle: the base must be wide enough to support the height. The standard rule is **3:1 base-to-height ratio** — a levee 2 feet tall requires a base at least 6 feet wide.

## Materials Needed

Before you build, gather everything in advance. Once flooding begins, supply chains tighten fast.

### Sandbags
- **Standard size:** 14" × 26" woven polypropylene bags (most common)
- **Fill weight:** 35–50 lbs per bag (2/3 full — never pack tight)
- **Quantity:** A 3-foot-tall levee running 20 linear feet requires approximately 200–250 sandbags

For detailed sandbag quantity planning, use our [sandbag calculator](/sandbag-calculator/).

### Fill Material
- **Coarse sand** — best choice; drains well and compacts firmly
- **Native soil** — acceptable if sandy or loamy; clay soil tends to wash out
- **Gravel** — workable for larger bags; heavier per bag
- Avoid organic fill (mulch, compost) — it degrades and loses structural integrity

### Tools
- Shovels (one per person filling)
- Sandbag filler stands (speeds up filling significantly)
- Work gloves (required — sandbag edges are abrasive)
- Knee pads (optional but strongly recommended for extended work)
- Plastic sheeting or poly tarp (6 mil minimum) for sealing the levee face
- Stakes or rebar for holding tarp edges

### Safety Equipment
- Rubber boots or waterproof footwear
- High-visibility vest if working near traffic
- First aid kit

## Site Selection and Preparation

The foundation of your levee determines everything. A poor foundation causes settlement, undermining, and breaches.

### Choose the Right Location

Place your levee:
- **On the high side of the water flow** — ideally 6–10 feet back from the water's edge to give yourself room to work
- **On firm, consolidated ground** — avoid soft, saturated, or recently disturbed soil
- **Away from utilities** — call 811 (USA) before digging or placing heavy materials on utility corridors
- **Parallel to water flow** — a levee perpendicular to fast-moving water concentrates pressure at the ends and can fail catastrophically

### Prepare the Ground

1. **Mow or cut vegetation** to ground level where the levee will sit — tall grass creates air gaps under the first bag layer
2. **Remove debris:** rocks, branches, toys — anything that prevents the bags from sitting flat
3. **Mark the levee line** with stakes and string before you start placing bags
4. **Wet dry ground slightly** — dusty soil under the first layer causes the bags to slip

### Assess Slope

A levee built on a slope channels water toward the low end. If you're building across sloped terrain, step the levee down in tiers so each section maintains a horizontal top.

## Step-by-Step Levee Construction

### Step 1: Lay the Base Layer

The base layer is the most critical part of the levee. It determines width, stability, and how much water pressure the structure can handle.

- Place bags **flat side down**, oriented **perpendicular to water flow** (bags run left-right, not front-to-back)
- Each bag should **overlap the next by 4–6 inches** — no gaps between bags on the same row
- For a 2-foot levee: base should be 3 bags wide (approximately 6 feet)
- For a 3-foot levee: base should be 4–5 bags wide (approximately 8–10 feet)
- Stamp and tamp each bag into the ground to eliminate air pockets

### Step 2: Stagger the Second Layer (Brick Pattern)

This is where most DIY levees fail — builders stack bags directly on top of each other like a wall. This creates vertical seams where water penetrates and the levee splits.

- Offset each layer by half a bag length — just like laying bricks
- The center of each bag in layer 2 should sit over the seam between two bags in layer 1
- Tuck the unfilled flap of each bag under the bag pointing away from the water

### Step 3: Taper the Sides

A proper levee tapers — the base is wide, the top is narrow. Think of a pyramid in cross-section.

**Standard taper:**
- Each successive layer is set back 6–12 inches from the waterward face
- The waterward face should be at approximately a 45-degree angle (or less steep)
- The landward face can be more vertical but should still step back slightly per layer

### Step 4: Continue Layering

- Keep alternating the stagger pattern on every layer
- Never let workers stand on top of the levee while building adjacent sections — weight on unsettled bags causes settlement and shifting
- Work systematically from one end to the other — don't jump around filling gaps

### Step 5: Cap the Top

The top of the levee needs to be level and wide enough to hold its shape. At least one bag wide on top (approximately 18 inches) is the minimum. Two bags wide is better for levees over 2 feet.

**Ensure the top is level** — any low point becomes where water overtops first.

### Step 6: Secure the Waterward Face

Once the levee is built, cover the waterward face (the side facing the water) with 6-mil polyethylene sheeting. This dramatically reduces water infiltration through the bags.

- Drape the tarp from the top, over the waterward face, and extend it 2–3 feet onto the ground in front of the levee
- Weigh the ground portion down with additional sandbags
- Overlap multiple tarp sections by at least 12 inches; tape seams with waterproof tape if available

## Sealing Gaps and Weak Points

Even a well-built levee has vulnerabilities. Here's how to find and fix them:

### End Sections
The ends of a levee are the most common failure point. Water wraps around the ends and undermines the structure.

- **Extend the levee beyond the threat zone** — ideally connecting to higher ground, a building foundation, or another structure
- Build the ends into a **J-shape or L-shape**, curling back toward the protected area
- Add extra bags at both ends, stacking 1–2 additional layers higher than the main levee

### Utility Penetrations
Pipes, conduits, and cables that run through or under your levee create seepage channels.

- Pack bags tightly around any pipe or cable crossings
- Fill gaps with sandbag fill material tamped by hand
- For critical seals, use hydraulic repair mortar or foam backer rod if available

### Uneven Ground Gaps
Where the base layer sits on uneven ground, gaps form underneath. 

- Stuff loose fill material into any gap wider than 1/2 inch
- Cut sandbags open to pour sand directly into large gaps along the base
- Use a shovel to tamp fill into voids before the second layer goes down

### Seepage Through the Levee Body
Some water infiltration through the body of a sandbag levee is normal and expected. Concern begins when you see:
- A stream of clear water coming through a specific point (suggests a continuous leak channel)
- Bags that appear to be washing out (sand exiting through the bag fabric)
- Subsidence (sagging) in a levee section

A poly tarp on the waterward face is the single most effective fix for seepage.

## How Long Does a Sandbag Levee Hold?

Realistic performance expectations help you plan evacuation and monitoring schedules.

### By Water Depth Against the Levee

| Water Depth vs. Levee Height | Expected Hold Time (Properly Built) |
|---|---|
| Water at 50% of levee height | 48–96 hours |
| Water at 75% of levee height | 24–72 hours |
| Water at 90% of levee height | 6–24 hours |
| Overtopping by any amount | Hours to minutes — failure imminent |

**Critical rule:** A sandbag levee should never be considered a permanent structure. Even a well-built levee begins to degrade after 48–72 hours of submersion as sand migrates, bag fabric weakens, and the foundation saturates.

### Factors That Reduce Hold Time
- **Wave action** — even small waves accelerate erosion of the waterward face
- **Seepage at the base** — once water finds a path underneath, it enlarges quickly
- **No poly tarp** — unprotected bags saturate and allow seepage
- **Fast-moving water** — current above 2 mph dramatically increases stress on end sections
- **Overfilled bags** — bags packed too tight are rigid, don't conform, and leave air gaps

### Factors That Extend Hold Time
- Poly tarp on waterward face (can double effective hold time)
- Levee ends tied into solid structures
- Monitoring and patching active seepage points early
- Water depth well below levee top (keep 12–18 inches of freeboard minimum)

## Common Levee Failures and How to Prevent Them

### Piping Failure
Water seeps through or under the levee, creating a channel (pipe) that gradually enlarges until the levee collapses. Prevention: tarp the waterward face, ensure the base is set on consolidated ground.

### Overtopping
The water level exceeds the levee height and begins flowing over the top. Prevention: maintain at least 12 inches of freeboard (levee top above water level). Monitor water levels hourly.

### Slope Failure (Slumping)
A section of the levee face gives way. Usually caused by too-steep a face angle, saturated bags, or insufficient base width. Prevention: maintain the 3:1 base-to-height ratio and 45-degree or shallower face angle.

### End Scour
Fast water wraps around the levee end and erodes the foundation. Prevention: extend ends into solid ground, curl ends back.

## Levee Removal and Disposal

Once floodwaters recede, levee removal must be handled carefully.

- **Do not remove the levee while water is still present** — even a small residual hydrostatic pressure can cause sudden release
- Allow water to recede fully and ground to partially dry before dismantling
- Sandbags that contacted floodwater may contain contaminants (sewage, chemicals) — wear gloves and boots during removal
- Contact your local emergency management office for disposal guidance — many municipalities have sandbag collection programs after flood events
- Bags that have not been contaminated can often be emptied, cleaned, and stored for reuse

For disposal guidance, see our [sandbag disposal guide](/sandbag-disposal/).
