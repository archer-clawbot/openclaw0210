### Introduction

Doorways are the most common flood entry point in homes and businesses. A standard exterior door sits on a threshold just fractions of an inch above floor level — and that small gap is all floodwater needs to begin pouring in.

A properly built sandbag door barrier is your first and most important line of defense. The technique is simple, but the details matter: bag orientation, stagger pattern, the pyramid shape, and how you handle the sides of the door frame all determine whether your barrier holds or fails.

This guide walks through the correct way to build a sandbag barrier for standard single doors, double doors, and provides a bridge to the full garage door guide for that specific challenge. For broader flooding strategy, start with [using sandbags for flooding](/sandbags-for-flooding/).

## How Many Sandbags Per Door?

For most standard exterior doors, plan on **15–25 sandbags** depending on the barrier height you need.

**Quick reference by flood depth:**

| Anticipated Flood Depth | Rows Needed | Sandbags Required (Single Door) |
|---|---|---|
| 6 inches | 2 rows | 8–12 bags |
| 12 inches (1 foot) | 3 rows | 15–20 bags |
| 18 inches | 4 rows | 22–30 bags |
| 24 inches (2 feet) | 5 rows | 35–45 bags |

These estimates assume standard 14"×26" bags at a standard door width of 36 inches. Wider doors (double doors, French doors) roughly double these numbers.

For exact calculations, use our [sandbag calculator](/sandbag-calculator/).

## Single Door Barrier: The 3-Row Pyramid Method

The pyramid method is the standard technique for door barriers because it creates a stable, self-supporting structure without requiring stakes or framing.

### Materials Needed
- 15–25 sandbags (standard 14"×26" polypropylene, filled 2/3 full)
- One sheet of 6-mil polyethylene plastic (optional but recommended)
- Work gloves

### Step-by-Step Instructions

**Step 1: Prepare the doorway**
Clear the area in front of the door and 12 inches to each side. Remove any mats, outdoor furniture, or debris. If the door has a bottom weatherstrip, leave it — it helps the seal.

**Step 2: Lay plastic sheeting (optional but effective)**
Before placing any bags, lay a sheet of 6-mil plastic across the doorway threshold, extending 2–3 feet outward and at least 1 foot into the doorway under the door. This plastic sheet acts as a seal between the bags and the threshold, filling microscopic gaps the bags can't reach. Tuck the inner edge under the door if possible.

**Step 3: Place the first row**
- Set bags flat, parallel to the door (the long axis of the bag runs left-right)
- Position the first bag centered on the doorway with its end touching the door frame
- Work outward from center, overlapping each bag by 4–6 inches
- The first row should extend 6–8 inches beyond each side of the door frame
- Stomp each bag to seat it firmly; the bag should be touching the door frame along its full length

**Step 4: Place the second row (staggered)**
- Offset the second row by half a bag length — brick-laying pattern
- Pull the unfilled flap of each bag under the bag, pointing away from the door
- Tamp down firmly after placing each bag
- This row should be slightly shorter than the first — you're building a pyramid

**Step 5: Add additional rows**
- Each successive row is offset (staggered), centered on the row below
- Each row is slightly narrower than the row below — the pyramid shape naturally forms
- The top row for a 3-row barrier typically has 2 bags

**Step 6: Check the sides**
The sides of the door frame where the barrier meets the house wall are critical. Water pressure finds corners. Pack additional bags tightly against the wall on each side of the door, sealing the gap between the last bag in each row and the wall.

## Double Door Barrier Technique

Double doors (French doors, storm doors with sidelights, double-wide entry doors) require more bags and extra attention to the center seam.

### The Center Seam Problem
Double doors have a vertical seam in the center where the two doors meet. This seam is a direct flood entry path. Water under pressure will find this gap before it finds the side jambs.

### Double Door Sealing Steps

1. **Seal the center seam first**: Before building the barrier, place a bead of plumber's putty, rope caulk, or even a rolled-up towel along the inside of the center door seam at the base. This is a temporary measure that buys significant protection.

2. **Build a wider base**: For a double door (typically 60–72 inches wide), your base row should extend 12 inches past each side of the door frame — making the base approximately 84–96 inches total.

3. **Follow the same pyramid method**: Same 3-row minimum, staggered layers, pyramid taper.

4. **Double the sandbags at the center**: In the first two rows, place bags in pairs at the center of the barrier (directly in front of the door seam). This concentrates more mass at the weakest point.

**Estimated sandbag count for double doors:** 30–50 bags for a 3-row barrier.

## What Goes Behind the Sandbags?

The sandbag barrier is on the outside of the door. What about the inside?

For serious flood threats (over 12 inches of expected water), add a secondary interior measure:

- **Interior sandbag row**: A single row of 4–6 sandbags placed just inside the door catches any water that seeps through the barrier
- **Absorbent flood barriers**: Commercial flood-barrier tubes (available at hardware stores) can be placed at the base of interior door frames
- **Towels + trash bags**: In a pinch, rolled wet towels stuffed against the interior base of the door with trash bag backing can slow minor seepage

The goal of the interior measure is not to stop flooding — it's to contain minor seepage and give you time.

## Common Door Barrier Mistakes

**Bags placed too loosely**: Air gaps between bags are water pathways. Every bag should be stomped firmly into contact with adjacent bags.

**Barrier not wide enough**: If the barrier doesn't extend past the door frame, water works around the sides. Always go at least 6–8 inches beyond each side of the door frame.

**No plastic sheeting**: Bags alone do not create a watertight seal against a smooth threshold. Plastic sheeting under the barrier dramatically improves the bottom seal.

**Overfilled bags**: A bag packed more than 2/3 full is rigid and convex — it contacts adjacent bags at the edges only, leaving a gap in the center. Fill to 2/3 for maximum contact and conformity.

**Barrier too tall for the structure**: A barrier over 2 feet tall pressing directly against a door may create enough pressure to buckle the door inward. For very high flood threats, build the barrier 6–12 inches away from the door itself.

## When Sandbags Aren't Enough for Doors

Sandbag door barriers work well for flood depths up to approximately 24–30 inches. Beyond that:

- Water pressure against the door itself becomes the limiting factor (not just seepage)
- The barrier requires more bags and careful construction than most homeowners can execute under pressure
- Commercial door flood barriers (panel systems, inflatable barriers) become significantly more reliable

If you're in a flood zone with regular events exceeding 2–3 feet, consider investing in a permanent door flood barrier system as a primary defense, with sandbags as backup.
