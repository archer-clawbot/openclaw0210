# Woven vs. Non-Woven Sandbags: Key Differences and When to Use Each

If you've shopped for sandbags recently, you may have seen both "woven" and "non-woven" options — particularly in the polypropylene category. These terms refer to how the fabric of the sandbag is manufactured, and the difference has real implications for performance, strength, permeability, and appropriate use.

Most homeowners will only ever need woven sandbags for flood protection. But understanding the distinction between woven and non-woven fabrics helps you make a better-informed purchase and avoid selecting a bag type that's optimized for a different application.

## What Are Woven Sandbags?

Woven sandbags are made from fabric produced by interlocking individual threads or strips in a grid pattern — the same fundamental technique as weaving a basket or piece of cloth. In polypropylene sandbags (the most common type), flat strips of PP plastic are woven over and under each other in alternating rows to create a strong, flexible mesh-like fabric.

Key characteristics of woven sandbag fabric:
- **High tensile strength**: The interlocked structure distributes stress across the entire fabric
- **Visible grid pattern**: You can see distinct rows and columns in the weave
- **Controlled permeability**: Openings in the weave allow some water and air movement
- **Maintains structure under load**: Woven bags hold their shape when filled with heavy material

Woven polypropylene is the material used in virtually all standard sandbags distributed during flood events, sold at hardware stores, and used by emergency management agencies. It's the industry standard for flood protection for good reason.

Woven sandbags are also made from natural fibers — burlap (jute) is a woven natural fabric. The same distinction between woven and non-woven applies in natural fiber products, though non-woven natural fiber bags are rarely used for flood protection.

## What Are Non-Woven Sandbags?

Non-woven fabrics are made without traditional weaving. Instead, fibers or filaments are bonded together through mechanical, thermal, or chemical processes — essentially pressing or fusing fibers into a sheet structure rather than weaving them together.

Think of it like the difference between a woven cotton shirt and a felt pad. Both are fabric, but the felt isn't woven — the fibers are bonded together.

Non-woven polypropylene fabric has a different set of characteristics:
- **Soft, felt-like texture**: No visible grid pattern; the surface appears uniform
- **High filtration efficiency**: The random fiber arrangement traps fine particles effectively
- **Lower tensile strength than woven PP**: Less suitable for holding heavy fill material under pressure
- **Higher permeability per unit area**: More water can pass through, making it excellent for filtration but poor for flood barrier fill containment
- **Better for geotextile applications**: Slope drainage, subbase filtration, erosion blankets

## Woven vs. Non-Woven: Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature | Woven | Non-Woven |
|---|---|---|
| Manufacturing method | Interlocked fiber strips | Bonded fiber mat |
| Tensile strength | High | Lower (varies by bonding method) |
| Permeability | Controlled (through weave gaps) | High (fiber-to-fiber spaces) |
| Particle filtration | Moderate | High |
| Fill containment | Excellent | Poor (fill leaks through easily) |
| UV resistance | Varies by material | Varies by material |
| Primary use | Flood sandbags, barrier bags | Geotextiles, erosion blankets, filtration |
| Common materials | PP, jute, burlap | PP, polyester |
| Cost | Moderate | Similar or lower |

## Why Woven Sandbags Are Best for Flood Protection

The critical advantage of woven fabric for flood sandbag use is **fill containment**. A sandbag must hold its fill material — sand or soil — securely under the weight of stacked bags, water pressure, and physical handling. Woven fabric is strong enough to contain fill material without significant leakage through the bag walls.

Non-woven polypropylene, while functional for drainage and filtration, is not appropriate as a sandbag for flood barriers. The fiber structure is too porous to effectively contain fine sand, and the lower tensile strength means bags are more susceptible to failure under load.

If you see a product marketed as a "non-woven sandbag" for flood protection, review the specifications carefully — in most cases, the product is either:
1. A woven bag with a non-woven liner (composite construction), or
2. A geotextile product being misapplied to flood barrier use

## When Non-Woven Products Are the Right Choice

Non-woven polypropylene materials are well-suited to several applications where sandbag-style bags aren't quite right:

### Erosion Control Blankets
Non-woven fabrics laid over disturbed soil slopes hold soil in place while allowing water to infiltrate, reducing surface erosion. These aren't bags — they're blankets or rolls — but they're part of the same product category as "non-woven sandbags" in some product listings.

### Subbase and Drainage Filtration
Non-woven geotextile fabric is commonly installed under road bases, driveways, and retaining walls to allow water drainage while preventing fine soil particles from migrating into drain gravel. This is a legitimate and important application, but it's distinct from flood protection.

### Silt Fence Applications
Silt fences used at construction sites to prevent sediment runoff often use non-woven fabrics because filtration is the primary function — slowing water and trapping particles while allowing water to pass through.

## Natural Fiber Woven vs. Synthetic Woven: A Secondary Comparison

Within woven sandbags, there's a further comparison between natural fiber (burlap, jute) and synthetic (polypropylene). This comparison is separate from woven vs. non-woven:

| Feature | Woven Natural (Burlap/Jute) | Woven Synthetic (Polypropylene) |
|---|---|---|
| Biodegradable | Yes | No |
| UV resistance | Low | High (if UV-treated) |
| Strength | Moderate | High |
| Moisture resistance | Low | High |
| Stored lifespan | 3–7 years | 10+ years |
| Best for | Short-term use, erosion control | Long-term, repeated-use applications |

For most flood protection applications, woven polypropylene sandbags provide the best balance of strength, durability, and cost. For erosion control or environmental applications where biodegradability matters, woven natural fiber bags are appropriate.

See our individual guides on [burlap sandbags](/burlap-sandbags/), [jute sandbags](/jute-sandbags/), and [polypropylene sandbags](/polypropylene-sandbags/) for detailed comparison of each material type.

## How to Identify Woven vs. Non-Woven Sandbags

If you're unsure whether a bag is woven or non-woven, here's how to tell:

**Woven**: Hold the fabric up to light. You'll see a distinct grid or criss-cross pattern of threads or strips. The fabric feels somewhat rigid along the weave lines.

**Non-woven**: Hold the fabric up to light. You'll see a random, fibrous texture — no visible grid. The fabric feels softer and more like felt.

For flood protection purposes, always select woven sandbags. If you're uncertain about what you're buying, ask the supplier for the product specification sheet, which will identify the fabric construction.

If you need woven polypropylene sandbags filled and delivered for a flood event, our [sandbag delivery service](/sandbag-delivery/) provides standard woven bags ready to stack. For volume filling of bags you've already sourced, our [sandbag filling service](/sandbag-filling-service/) is available.

### What is the difference between woven and non-woven sandbags?

Woven sandbags are made from interlocked fiber strips (like fabric), giving them high strength and fill containment. Non-woven bags are made from bonded fiber mats (like felt), giving them high permeability and filtration but lower strength. Woven bags are used for flood protection; non-woven materials are used for geotextile and drainage applications.

### Are non-woven sandbags good for flood protection?

Generally no. Non-woven polypropylene is too porous to effectively contain fine sand fill, and it has lower tensile strength than woven fabric. For flood barriers, woven sandbags (polypropylene or natural fiber) are the correct choice.

### How can I tell if a sandbag is woven or non-woven?

Hold the bag up to light. Woven fabric shows a clear grid or criss-cross pattern of strips or threads. Non-woven fabric shows a random, fibrous texture with no visible pattern — similar to felt. Woven bags feel slightly stiffer and more structured.

### Which is stronger — woven or non-woven polypropylene?

Woven polypropylene is generally stronger in tensile strength — the interlocked structure distributes stress effectively. Non-woven materials can be engineered for specific strength requirements but are typically lower strength at comparable weights for sandbag applications.

### What are non-woven sandbags used for?

Non-woven polypropylene materials are primarily used in geotextile applications: erosion control blankets, subbase filtration layers, silt fences, and drainage fabrics. They're not commonly used as fill-containment sandbags for flood protection.

### Does woven or non-woven allow more water through?

Non-woven fabrics generally allow more water to pass through per unit area than woven fabrics of similar weight. The random fiber structure creates more pathways for water movement. This is why non-woven materials are preferred for drainage filtration, while woven materials are preferred for flood barriers where reducing water infiltration is the goal.
