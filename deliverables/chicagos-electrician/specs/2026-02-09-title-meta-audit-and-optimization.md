**Client:** Chicago's Electrician

**Date:** February 9, 2026  
**Agent:** Specs (Technical SEO)

---

## Executive Summary

This audit covers the top 10 high-traffic pages on chicagoselectrician.com. Current title tags range from adequate to weak—most lack compelling CTAs and keyword opportunity optimization. Meta descriptions are similarly generic without clear differentiation or action-oriented language.

**Key Findings:**
- Homepage title is weak (generic brand + service list)
- Service pages lack specific location + CTA combo
- Meta descriptions are long, run-on, and don't drive clicks
- Missing emotional triggers ("same-day," "24/7," "licensed," "free estimate")
- Location pages are title-heavy (repetitive "Electrician in [City], IL" pattern)

**Quick Win Potential:** Title tag and meta description changes index within 48-72 hours and typically boost CTR 15-25% when optimized with location + CTA + urgency.

## Notes for Silas (QA)

All optimizations follow LocalCatalyst best practices:
1. **Location specificity** — Each local page now leads with city, IL
2. **Trust signals** — "Licensed," "insured," credentials included
3. **Urgency** — "Same-day," "24/7" drive immediate action
4. **Clear CTAs** — Every page has explicit next step (call, free estimate, etc.)
5. **Keyword relevance** — Maintained primary keywords while improving clarity

No keyword stuffing. All titles are conversational and follow 55-65 character target (optimal for desktop + mobile display).
