## 1. Target Page Selection & Prioritization

### Tier 1: High-Priority Service Pages (60% of link budget)

| Page URL | Target Type | Monthly Volume Est. | Conversion Value | Link Allocation |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|------------------|-----------------|
| `/` (Homepage) | Authority Hub | High | Very High | 8 links |
| `/residential-electrician/` | Service Page | 2,900 (electrician chicago) | High | 7 links |
| `/commercial-electrician/` | Service Page | 1,600 (commercial electrician) | Very High | 7 links |
| `/lighting-services/` | Service Page | 880 (lighting installation) | Medium | 5 links |

**Rationale:**
- Homepage anchors domain authority and distributes link equity
- Residential electrician competes for highest search volume
- Commercial electrician has higher conversion value (larger ticket jobs)
- Lighting services represents growing niche (LED upgrades, smart lighting)

### Tier 2: Strategic Location Pages (25% of link budget)

| Page URL | Target Type | Local Opportunity | Link Allocation |
|----------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| `/locations/best-electrician-in-roselle/` | Location Hub | HQ location, highest local relevance | 4 links |
| `/locations/quality-electrical-services-in-naperville/` | Location Page | Large suburb, high competition | 3 links |
| `/locations/expert-electrical-services-in-schaumburg/` | Location Page | Commercial district opportunity | 3 links |

**Rationale:**
- Roselle is physical HQ location — critical for local pack
- Naperville and Schaumburg represent high-value commercial markets
- Location pages need authority to rank in Map Pack for "[city] electrician"

### Tier 3: Supporting Service Pages (15% of link budget)

| Page URL | Target Type | Strategic Value | Link Allocation |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| `/security-systems/` | Service Page | Differentiator, recurring revenue | 3 links |
| `/power-backup/` | Service Page | High-ticket service (generators) | 3 links |
| `/electrical-services/` | Service Overview | Internal link hub | 2 links |
| `/cabling/` | Service Page | Commercial niche | 2 links |

**Rationale:**
- Security systems and generators = high-margin upsells
- Electrical services page acts as internal linking hub
- Cabling targets commercial clients (structured cabling for offices)

## 3. Link Velocity Plan

### 6-Month Staged Deployment

**Philosophy:** Gradual ramp-up that mimics organic editorial link acquisition. Front-load authority pages (homepage, main service pages), then layer in location and niche service pages.

| Month | Links Deployed | Target Pages | Rationale |
|-------|----------------|--------------|-----------|
| **Month 1** | 6 links | Homepage (2), Residential (2), Commercial (2) | Establish baseline authority on primary pages |
| **Month 2** | 8 links | Homepage (2), Residential (2), Commercial (2), Lighting (2) | Continue building core service authority |
| **Month 3** | 10 links | Residential (2), Commercial (2), Roselle (2), Naperville (2), Schaumburg (2) | Shift focus to location pages for local pack boost |
| **Month 4** | 8 links | Homepage (2), Lighting (2), Security (2), Power Backup (2) | Diversify into supporting service pages |
| **Month 5** | 9 links | Residential (1), Commercial (1), Roselle (2), Electrical Services (2), Cabling (2), Security (1) | Round out location and niche pages |
| **Month 6** | 7 links | Homepage (2), Naperville (1), Schaumburg (1), Power Backup (1), Lighting (1), Cabling (0) | Final reinforcement of priority targets |
| **Total** | **48 links** | 12 pages across all tiers | — |

### Link Placement Timing Best Practices

- **Avoid patterns:** Randomize placement days (no "every Monday" deployments)
- **Spread across month:** Target 2-3 links per week, never 3+ on same day
- **Seasonal considerations:**
  - **Spring (March-May):** Outdoor lighting, generator season prep
  - **Summer (June-August):** Peak construction season, commercial jobs
  - **Fall (September-November):** Electrical safety, indoor projects
  - **Winter (December-February):** Emergency electrician, power backup

**Footprint Avoidance:**
- No more than 1 link from same PBN domain in a single month
- Stagger anchor text types (avoid clustering exact-match anchors)
- Vary link placement within content (intro, mid-body, conclusion)

---

## 4. Link Type & Placement Strategy

### Preferred Link Placement: Contextual Blog Posts

All 48 links will be placed within **original, long-form blog content** (1,200-2,000 words) hosted on aged PBN domains with relevant topical authority.

- **Mid-Body Contextual (70% of links):** Naturally embedded in relevant paragraphs, often following a problem/solution setup
- **Resource/Further Reading (15% of links):** Placed near end as "recommended resource" or "expert provider"

#### HTML & Technical Specs
- **Dofollow ratio:** 90% dofollow, 10% nofollow (to maintain natural profile)
- **Link attributes:** Use standard `<a href>` tags, no rel="sponsored" or "ugc" (PBNs should appear editorial)
- **Anchor styling:** Match surrounding text, no special formatting
- **Placement depth:** Links embedded 300-1,500 words into content (avoid footer/sidebar)

#### Example Contextual Placement

**Topic:** "Electrical Safety Checklist Before Buying a Chicago Home"

> "Before closing on a property in the Chicagoland area, schedule a comprehensive electrical inspection with a licensed professional. A qualified **residential electrician in Chicago** can identify outdated wiring, overloaded circuits, and code violations that might not be obvious during a standard home inspection. This due diligence can save you thousands in post-purchase repairs..."

**Target:** /residential-electrician/  
**Anchor:** "residential electrician in Chicago" (partial match)  
**Placement:** Mid-body, paragraph 4 of 10, contextually supporting advice

## Deployment Workflow for Ghost

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

1. **PBN Domain Selection:**
   - Choose 48 unique PBN domains (no domain used more than once)
   - Prioritize domains with:
     - DR 20+ (Ahrefs)
     - Indexed in Google (site: operator check)
     - Relevant topical history (home services, local business, DIY, tech)
     - Clean backlink profile (no spam indicators)

2. **Content Staging:**
   - Receive 48 completed blog posts from Scribe
   - QA each post for readability, link placement, and anchor accuracy
   - Add 1-2 relevant images per post (stock photos, diagrams)

3. **Deployment Schedule:**
   - Map each post to specific deployment date per velocity calendar
   - Randomize posting times (avoid patterns like "always 9am Tuesday")
   - Stagger by week and day to avoid clustering

### Deployment Execution

For each post deployment, Ghost should:

1. **Publish content** to assigned PBN domain
2. **Verify link is live** (dofollow, correct URL, correct anchor)
3. **Index content** (submit to Google via IndexNow or manual fetch)
4. **Document deployment** in tracking sheet:
   - Date published
   - PBN domain used
   - Target page
   - Anchor text
   - Dofollow/Nofollow status
   - Post URL

### Post-Deployment Monitoring

- **Week 1:** Verify all links are crawled by Google (check GSC)
- **Week 2-4:** Monitor for any link drops or PBN issues
- **Monthly:** Spot-check 10% of links to ensure still live and dofollow
- **Quarterly:** Full link audit to confirm all 48 links remain active

---

## Risk Mitigation & Footprint Avoidance

### Footprint Prevention Checklist

- ✅ **No IP clustering:** PBNs hosted on different C-class IPs
- ✅ **Different CMS platforms:** Mix WordPress, Ghost, static HTML sites
- ✅ **Unique WHOIS data:** Use privacy protection or varied registrar info
- ✅ **Different hosting providers:** Spread across multiple hosts
- ✅ **Varied site designs:** No duplicate themes or templates
- ✅ **Natural content mix:** PBNs publish other content, not just links to money site
- ✅ **No interlinking:** PBN sites never link to each other
- ✅ **Aged domains:** Prefer domains 5+ years old with clean history

### Manual Action Prevention

- Avoid exact-match anchor clustering (15% max exact match)
- Maintain 10% nofollow links to mimic editorial link profiles
- Never link from obviously spammy or unrelated PBN content
- Keep link velocity gradual (no sudden spikes of 10+ links/week)
- Monitor Google Search Console for manual action notifications

### Contingency Plans

**If PBN domain gets deindexed:**
- Remove link or migrate content to replacement PBN
- Track deindexed domain, avoid future use
- Adjust velocity plan if multiple domains affected

**If rankings drop unexpectedly:**
- Pause deployments for 2-4 weeks
- Audit for footprints or algorithmic changes
- Assess if competitor attack or Google update

**If manual action received:**
- Immediately pause all PBN deployments
- Audit backlink profile for obvious footprints
- Prepare disavow file if necessary (last resort)
