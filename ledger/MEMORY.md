---

## ANOMALY ALERTS

✅ No alerts this week.
- No daily spend spikes
- No single-agent anomalies
- All clients profitable with comfortable margin

---

## Notes

- **Week 1 baseline**: Both clients onboarded Feb 9-10; heavy audit/setup work inflates initial costs
- **High token usage** from Archer/Silas (audit suites, comprehensive schema deployment)
- **Tool licensing**: One-time allocation for initial setup (will stabilize next week)
- **No optimization needed yet** — all costs justified by deliverables

---

## Next Steps

1. Monitor Week 2 spend (Feb 16-22) — expect lower token usage as audit phase completes
2. Track hosting utilization — initial allocation may be conservative
3. Flag any sustained high Opus usage (cost driver)
4. Validate tool ROI by end of February
