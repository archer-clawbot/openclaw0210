- No "call for pricing" BS
- Someone who educates, not just sells

### Stage 3: Evaluation
**Behavior:**
- Takes Safety Scorecard quiz → Gets 68/100 (YELLOW: Moderate Risk)
- Learns her 1998 panel may be undersized for modern demands
- Discovers GFCI outlets missing in bathrooms (code violation)
- Realizes flickering lights = loose wiring = potential fire hazard

**Emotional State:**

**Objections:**
- "Is this too expensive?" → Overcomes by calculating cost of emergency repair vs. prevention
- "Do I really need all this?" → Overcomes with safety audit findings (sees it's not upselling, it's necessary)
- "What if they don't honor the guarantee?" → Overcomes with Lifetime Workmanship Guarantee + reputation
