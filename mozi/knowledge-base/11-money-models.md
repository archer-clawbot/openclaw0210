## Core Concept

A Money Model is a sequence of offers. Making one offer works better than making none. Making more offers works better than making one. The most profitable businesses combine all four offer types in a deliberate sequence.

## The Four Offer Types

### 1. Attraction Offers — Turn Strangers Into Customers
**Purpose:** Get people in the door. Generate leads and convert them into first-time buyers.
**How:** Free or heavily discounted front-end offer that demonstrates value
**Key principle:** "Get flow. Monetize flow. Then add friction."

**Types of Attraction Offers:**
- Free lead magnets
- Free trials / samples
- Loss-leader products (sell at cost or below)
- Massively discounted intro offers (50%+ off)
- Pay-for-performance / "you don't pay unless X"

**Goal:** Not to profit on this offer—it's to acquire a customer cheaply so you can profit on subsequent offers.

### 2. Upsell Offers — Get People to Spend More
**Purpose:** Increase average transaction value from existing customers
**How:** Offer more valuable/comprehensive solutions after initial purchase
**When:** At the point of purchase or at peak satisfaction

**Types:**
- Premium tier / upgrade
- Done-for-you add-on
- Accelerator / priority access
- Bundled complementary products
- Higher-commitment packages

**Key insight:** "It is much easier to upsell a customer than to make someone into a customer." The first micro-purchase makes everything else feel like an upsell, not a first-time sale.

### 3. Downsell Offers — Turn "No" Into "Yes"
**Purpose:** Capture revenue from people who would otherwise walk away
**How:** Offer a lesser version when someone says no to the main offer
**When:** After someone declines the core or upsell offer

**Types:**
- Payment plan (same thing, spread over time)
- Smaller/shorter version
- DIY version (instead of done-for-you)
- Digital version (instead of in-person)
- Group version (instead of 1-on-1)

### 4. Continuity Offers — Keep People Buying
**Purpose:** Generate recurring, predictable revenue
**How:** Subscription, membership, retainer, or consumable model
**When:** After initial value has been demonstrated

**Types:**
- Monthly membership / subscription
- Retainer agreements
- Consumable products (auto-ship)
- Maintenance / ongoing service plans
- Community access

**Key insight:** Continuity offers are the most valuable because they compound. A customer paying $100/month for 36 months = $3,600 LTV without any additional selling.

## The Money Model Sequence

```
Stranger → Attraction Offer → Customer → Upsell Offer → Higher Value Customer
                                    ↓ (says no)
                              Downsell Offer → Lower Value Customer
                                    ↓
                              Continuity Offer → Recurring Revenue
```

## Building Your Money Model

1. Start with whatever offer you can make NOW (usually attraction)
2. Add the next offer type that solves your biggest revenue constraint
3. Layer offers over time as you learn what customers want next
4. Each solved problem reveals a new problem = new offer opportunity

## Key Principles

- "Hard selling is for weak products" — Make offers available when customers have the problem
- Give money back if asked — avoid headaches, focus on getting better customers
- Be transparent — state facts, don't lie
- Any offer can work standalone, but they're exponentially better in sequence
- "If a customer asks for their money back—give it back."

## Decision Criteria

- No customers? → Build Attraction Offer first
- Customers but low revenue per customer? → Add Upsell Offers
- Losing too many potential customers? → Add Downsell Offers
- Revenue is unpredictable month to month? → Add Continuity Offers
