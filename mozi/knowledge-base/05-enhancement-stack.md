## Core Concept

Once your Grand Slam Offer is built, enhance it with five psychological levers that increase demand and decrease perceived supply WITHOUT changing the core offer. These forces are often MORE powerful than the core offer itself.

## The Delicate Dance of Desire

"Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want." — Naval Ravikant

- Demand and supply are inversely correlated
- Satisfy ALL demand = kill your golden goose
- Satisfy ZERO demand = make no money
- Sweet spot: keep supply UNDER demand to maximize profit and keep desire ravenous
- "The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make"

## 1. SCARCITY — Decrease Supply to Raise Prices

**Types of Scarcity:**
- **Physical products:** Limited quantity ("Only 50 available")
- **Service capacity:** Limited seats/spots ("Only taking 5 clients this quarter")
- **Time-based:** Limited enrollment windows ("Doors close Friday")
- **Cohort/class-based:** ("Next cohort starts March 1, only 10 spots")
- **One-of-a-kind:** Unique items, custom work

**Rules:**
- Scarcity must be REAL or you destroy trust
- Create genuine capacity constraints in your business
- Communicate scarcity honestly and early
- When demand increases, cut supply (not the other way around)

## 2. URGENCY — Increase Demand by Decreasing Action Threshold

**Types of Urgency:**
- **Deadline-based:** "Price goes up Friday at midnight"
- **Cohort/rolling:** "Next group starts in 3 weeks"
- **Seasonal/event-based:** "Back-to-school special ends September 1"
- **Exploding offers:** "This price is only available during our call today"

**Rules:**
- Urgency must be REAL
- Pair urgency with a legitimate reason WHY ("We can only onboard X clients per month because...")
- Stack urgency on top of scarcity for maximum effect

## 3. BONUSES — Increase Perceived Value

**How bonuses work:**
- Each bonus solves an adjacent problem or objection
- Bonuses should be things that are LOW COST to you but HIGH PERCEIVED VALUE
- Name each bonus with a sexy, specific name
- Assign a dollar value to each bonus
- Stack bonuses so total perceived value far exceeds the price

**Best bonus types:**
- Templates, checklists, tools (one-time creation, infinite distribution)
- Access to exclusive community/group
- Recordings of trainings/workshops
- Done-for-you components
- Priority/expedited service
- 1-on-1 strategy sessions (time-limited)

**Bonus timing:** Reveal bonuses AFTER the core offer presentation to re-engage attention and overcome objections.

## 4. GUARANTEES — Reverse Risk to Increase Demand

**Types of Guarantees:**

### Unconditional Guarantees
- "Money-back, no questions asked"
- Strongest risk reversal but highest risk to you
- Works best when you have strong fulfillment

### Conditional Guarantees
- "If you don't get [specific result] in [timeframe], we'll [guarantee action]"
- "Do X, Y, Z and if you don't get [result], we refund you"
- Lower risk to you because conditions filter out non-performers

### Anti-Guarantees
- "All sales final. This is for serious people only."
- Works when you have overwhelming proof/authority
- Actually increases perceived value through exclusivity

### Performance-Based
- "You don't pay unless [specific measurable result]"
- Most powerful guarantee type
- Requires confidence in your delivery

### Stacked Guarantees
- Combine multiple guarantee types for maximum effect
- "If you don't get 20 new customers in 30 days, we work for free until you do. And if after 90 days you're still not satisfied, we'll refund every penny."

## 5. NAMING — Re-stimulate Demand and Expand Awareness

**The MAGIC Formula for Naming:**
- **M**agnet — Make a magnetic reason to pay attention
- **A**nnounce — Announce your offer clearly  
- **G**oal — State the goal/dream outcome
- **I**nterval — Give a specific time interval
- **C**ontainer — Wrap it in a container word (challenge, system, blueprint, accelerator, bootcamp)

**Examples:**
- Bad: "8-Week Fitness Program" 
- Good: "The 6-Week Lean Body Accelerator"
- Bad: "SEO Services Package"
- Good: "The 90-Day Local Domination System"

**Rules:**
- Change names periodically to re-stimulate demand (same offer, new wrapper)
- Names should communicate the outcome, not the process
- Use specific numbers when possible
- Alliteration and rhythm help memorability

## Enhancement Stack Order

Apply in this order for maximum effect:
1. Build Grand Slam Offer (core value)
2. Add Guarantees (reverse risk)
3. Stack Bonuses (increase perceived value)
4. Apply Scarcity (limit supply)
5. Layer Urgency (create action threshold)
6. Name it (make it memorable and shareable)

## Decision Criteria

Use the full enhancement stack when:
- Launching a new offer
- Conversion rates plateau
- Competitors are copying your core offer
- Need to justify a price increase
- Running a promotional campaign
