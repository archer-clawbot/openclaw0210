## Core Concept

Lead Getters are other people and entities who do the Core Four on your behalf. This is how you move from doing everything yourself to building a lead generation machine. There are four types of Lead Getters, each applying the Core Four in their own way.

## The Four Lead Getters

### 1. Customer Referrals (Word of Mouth)
**What:** Your existing customers bring you new leads
**Why it works:** Highest trust transfer, lowest cost, best quality leads
**How to systematize it:**
- Ask for referrals at the point of peak satisfaction (after first win)
- Make referring easy (give them exact language, links, templates)
- Incentivize both the referrer AND the referred
- Build referral requests into your standard process (not ad hoc)

**Key insight:** Referrals don't happen by accident at scale. You must build a SYSTEM. "If you don't have a referral system, you have a referral wish."

### 2. Employees
**What:** People you hire to do the Core Four for you
**Why it works:** Direct control, scalable, builds enterprise value
**How they work:**
- Employees run the "Internal Core Four" — they do warm outreach, create content, run cold outreach, and manage paid ads on your behalf
- Each employee is a multiplier of your advertising capacity
- Key: train them on your proven systems, don't expect them to figure it out

**The leverage math:** If you can do the Core Four yourself, you can train 5 people to each do one piece. Now you have 5x the output with oversight rather than execution.

### 3. Agencies
**What:** External businesses whose service IS getting you leads
**Why it works:** Specialized expertise, faster ramp-up, no hiring/training
**When to use:** When you need specialized skills (paid ads management, SEO, content production) and the economics work
**Key considerations:**
- Agencies cost more per lead but save your time
- Vet agencies by their results for businesses like yours
- Never outsource strategy—only execution
- Track their performance against your in-house benchmarks

### 4. Affiliates & Partners
**What:** Other businesses who tell their audiences about your stuff
**Why it works:** Instant access to someone else's warm audience, trust transfer
**How to structure:**
- Revenue share / commission model (pay for performance)
- Provide affiliates with assets: copy, creative, landing pages, email swipes
- The better you make your affiliate program, the more affiliates promote you
- Treat affiliates like customers—make it easy and profitable for them

**Key insight:** Affiliates are doing the Core Four to THEIR audience for YOUR offer. You get their warm audience without building it yourself.

## The Lead Getter Multiplier

Each Lead Getter applies the Core Four independently:
- You doing Core Four = 1x output
- You + 5 employees + 2 agencies + 10 affiliates = massive multiplication

This is how businesses scale from $1M to $10M to $100M. You go from doing the Core Four yourself to having dozens or hundreds of people/entities doing it for you.

## Recommended Sequence

1. **Start:** Do Core Four yourself (prove it works)
2. **First hire:** Employee to take over your weakest/most time-consuming Core Four method
3. **Scale:** Add referral system for existing customers
4. **Accelerate:** Bring on agency for specialized channels (paid ads, SEO)
5. **Multiply:** Launch affiliate/partner program

## Decision Criteria

- Maxed out your personal capacity? → Hire employees
- Customers love you but not referring? → Build referral system
- Need specialized skills fast? → Hire an agency
- Want exponential reach? → Launch affiliate program
