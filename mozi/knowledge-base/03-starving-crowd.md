# Starving Crowd — Market Selection

## Core Concept

Your market matters more than your offer or your sales skills. A starving crowd will buy from anyone. The hierarchy: Starving Crowd (market) > Offer Strength > Persuasion Skills. You are not trying to CREATE demand—you are trying to CHANNEL it.

## The Four Market Indicators

### 1. Massive Pain
They must DESPERATELY need what you offer, not just casually want it. The degree of pain is proportional to the price you can charge. "The pain is the pitch"—if you can articulate their pain accurately, they will almost always buy.

### 2. Purchasing Power
Your audience must be able to afford what you charge. A resume service for unemployed people fails here. Target people with money or access to money.

### 3. Easy to Target
Can you actually FIND these people? Look for: associations, mailing lists, social media groups, industry channels, conferences, directories. If finding them is like needles in a haystack, pick a different market.

### 4. Growing
Growing markets are tailwinds—everything moves forward faster. Declining markets are headwinds—all efforts are harder. Don't sell to newspapers in 2024.

## The Three Eternal Markets

All markets fall into three categories that will always have demand:
1. **Health** — physical, mental, wellness
2. **Wealth** — making money, saving money, investing
3. **Relationships** — romantic, family, professional

Find a SUBGROUP within one of these that has pain + purchasing power + easy targeting + growth.

## Priority Order

```
Great Market + Bad Offer + Bad Sales = Still Make Money
Normal Market + Great Offer + Bad Sales = Make Good Money  
Normal Market + Normal Offer + Great Sales = Make Some Money
Bad Market + Great Offer + Great Sales = Struggle
```

## Decision Framework for Niche Selection

Score each factor 1-10:
- Pain level: ___/10
- Purchasing power: ___/10
- Ease of targeting: ___/10
- Market growth: ___/10

If any factor scores below 4, consider a different market. If total is below 24, seriously reconsider.

## Key Insight

Same entrepreneur + different market = wildly different results. The Lloyd story: failed selling to newspapers (dying market), pivoted to masks during COVID (exploding market), went from struggling to millions/month. Same skills, different market.
