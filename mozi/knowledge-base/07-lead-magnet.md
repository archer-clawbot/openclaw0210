## Core Concept

A lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrow problem offered for free (or very low cost) that gets strangers to show interest in what you sell. It should be valuable enough that someone would pay for it on its own. "Make your lead magnet so insanely good people will feel stupid saying no."

## Seven Steps to Creating an Effective Lead Magnet

### Step 1: Identify the Problem to Solve
Pick ONE narrow, specific problem your prospect has. It should be a subset of the bigger problem your core offer solves.
- If core offer = "Grow your restaurant revenue" 
- Lead magnet = "How to get 50 more Google reviews in 30 days"

### Step 2: Pick the Type
Three types of lead magnets:
1. **Reveal the Problem** — Diagnose/audit. Show them what's wrong. ("Free SEO audit shows exactly why you're invisible on Google")
2. **Give a Sample** — Let them taste your service. ("Free trial week / first session free")
3. **Give One Step** — Solve one piece of the puzzle. ("The exact email template that books 3 appointments per day")

### Step 3: Choose the Delivery Vehicle
Four delivery formats:
1. **Software/Tool** — Calculator, template, spreadsheet, app
2. **Information** — PDF, video, course, webinar, checklist
3. **Service** — Free consultation, audit, assessment, trial
4. **Physical** — Samples, books, kits

3 types × 4 delivery vehicles = 12 possible lead magnets for a single problem. Make as many as you can and rotate them.

### Step 4: Name It Using the MAGIC Formula
- **M** — Magnetic reason to pay attention
- **A** — Announce the offer
- **G** — Goal/dream outcome
- **I** — Time interval
- **C** — Container word

Example: "The 5-Minute Local SEO Checklist That Doubled Our Client's Map Pack Rankings"

### Step 5: Make It Easy to Consume
If they can't consume it quickly, it won't work. Keep it short, actionable, and immediately useful. 

### Step 6: Make It So Good They Want More
The lead magnet should create a "new problem" that your core offer solves. Diagnose → now they need treatment. Give one step → now they need the rest.

### Step 7: Test and Iterate
"If people engage in droves, you've got a winner." If not, change the packaging, the name, or the magnet itself. 5x more people read the headline than consume the content—so fix the headline first.

## Key Insight: The Problem-Solution Chain

Your lead magnet solves Problem A → which reveals Problem B → which your core offer solves → which reveals Problem C → which your upsell solves. Each solved problem creates a new one.

## Decision Criteria

Use lead magnets when:
- Running paid ads (always pair with a lead magnet, never just your core offer)
- Cold outreach (offer something free before asking for a meeting)
- Content strategy (use as CTA on all content)
- Any time conversion from stranger → engaged lead is too low
