## Core Concept

Not all customers are equal. The Vista Equity method: find the customers who stay the longest and pay the most, then double down on getting more of THOSE customers and cut channels that bring low-value ones. 20% of customers bring 80% of revenue. Replace the 80% with high-value customers and you 5x the business.

## The Four-Step Avatar Process

### Step 1: Survey Your Customers
Send a comprehensive survey. Collect:
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, location, marital status, solo vs partnered
- **Business Stats:** Revenue, profit, employees, churn, pricing, niche, time in business
- **Aspirations:** What was their goal? What problem were they trying to solve?
- **Buying Process:** Why did they buy? What content did they consume? Trigger event? Referral? First touchpoint? Time from awareness to purchase?

### Step 2: Find Your Biggest Spenders
Sort by: spent the most + stayed the longest + liked the most. Focus on the top 20%. Ignore the rest.

### Step 3: See What They Have in Common
Read through all answers. Find the FEWEST qualifiers they all share. Usually 3-5 common traits. This is your ideal customer profile.

### Step 4: Execute
**4a — Speak to your new avatar:**
- State your customer requirements explicitly in advertising
- Speak ONLY about the specific problems and aspirations of your best customers
- You will repel bad customers and attract good ones
- Stop selling anyone who doesn't meet requirements. Seriously, stop.
- Increase effort on channels these people come through

**4b — Re-engineer the sales process:**
- Look at what caused the best customers to buy
- Reverse-engineer their buying journey
- Make that journey happen on purpose for all prospects

## Real-World Example: Gym Launch

**Findings about best customers:**
- Demographics: Conservative, married, male, 25-45, US-based gym owner
- Business: Signed lease, 1+ employees, $10K+/month revenue, 30+ existing clients
- Aspirations: $1M+ gym, work less, open more locations
- Buying reasons: Not enough leads, "bad market," bad pricing, can't find employees

**Findings about how they bought:**
- 78% consumed AT LEAST two pieces of long-form content before buying
- Action: Injected two long-form value pieces into every buyer journey, armed sales team with "greatest hits" content

**Result:** Same market, same effort → 6-8x higher LTV ($45,000 vs competitors' $6,000-$8,000) → breathtaking margin differences

## Key Insights

**"You Make More Because of Who They Are, Not Because of Who You Are"**
Same work for a $100K/month company vs a $10M/month company produces the same percentage improvement. But 2% of $10M is $200K. Charge based on customer value, not your effort.

**"Sell To People Who Don't Stop Buying"**
Limit your avatar to people who keep buying. Either improve your product so ALL customers continue, or limit to people with those traits.

**Quality > Quantity**
Every time Hormozi removed qualification steps, lead volume increased but revenue decreased. More qualified leads = fewer but more valuable customers.

## Decision Criteria

Apply this framework when:
- Lots of customers but thin margins
- High churn rate
- Spending too much time on low-value clients
- Marketing feels generic/unfocused
- Want to raise prices but worried about volume
