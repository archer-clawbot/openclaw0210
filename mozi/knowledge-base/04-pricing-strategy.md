## Core Concept

Charge as much money as humanly possible. The goal is a massive discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge. Think 100x, not 2-3x. If you provide enough value, it should STILL be a steal for the prospect. That is the power of value—it unleashes unlimited pricing and profit power.

## The Commodity Problem

When your offer looks like everyone else's, you're in a pricing war. The only differentiator becomes price, and someone will always go lower. A Grand Slam Offer solves this by making you incomparable.

Two types of markets:
1. **Commoditized market:** Many competitors, similar offers, price-driven decisions
2. **Category of one:** Your offer is so differentiated it can't be compared

## Premium Pricing Math

- Business A: $100/sale, $50 profit → needs 190 sales for $9,500 profit
- Business B: $10,000/sale, $9,500 profit → needs 1 sale for $9,500 profit
- Even at 5% close rate on same 190 leads: Business B makes $90,250 (9.5x more)

Higher prices also mean: fewer customers to manage, higher quality customers, more resources to deliver, better results, more referrals.

## Pricing Framework

1. Find a growing market with massive pain and purchasing power
2. Build a Grand Slam Offer that solves all perceived problems
3. Price based on VALUE delivered, not cost of delivery or competitor pricing
4. Use the Value Equation to justify premium pricing
5. "Pay one time. Just pay me X% of what I make you. I guarantee [specific result]."

## The Virtuous Cycle of Premium Pricing

Higher price → More resources to deliver → Better results → More proof → Higher perceived value → Can charge even more → Repeat

## Key Insight: Value-Based vs Pay-for-Performance

Hormozi's software example: Switched from "$1,000/month retainer" to "Pay us $X for every person who shows up. We guarantee 20 people in your first month or you don't pay." Result: 20x more revenue per customer. Same fulfillment. Different framing.

## Decision Criteria

Raise prices when:
- You're charging less than 10x your cost of delivery
- Customers are getting great results but you're not profiting proportionally
- Your offer is differentiated but priced like competitors
- You have more demand than you can serve
