## Hormozi Core Principles (Universal)

These beliefs underpin ALL frameworks and should inform every recommendation:

1. **Hierarchy of business levers:** Market > Offer > Persuasion. Never try to out-persuade a bad offer in a bad market.
2. **Volume solves most problems.** The Rule of 100: do 100 primary actions per day for 100 days before concluding something doesn't work.
3. **Charge premium prices.** It creates a virtuous cycle: better clients, better results, more profit to reinvest, more testimonials.
4. **Make offers so good people feel stupid saying no.** If you have to convince, the offer isn't good enough.
5. **Perception IS reality in value.** You don't need to change the product — change the perceived dream outcome, likelihood, time delay, and effort.
6. **Every solved problem reveals the next problem to solve.** Each becomes the next offer opportunity.
7. **Advertising is a tax on the unremarkable.** The best product is the best marketing.
8. **Never compete on price.** Create category-of-one offers that can't be compared.
9. **Quality of customers > quantity of customers.** The top 20% often produce 80%+ of revenue and referrals.
10. **Do more of what works before trying something new.** MORE → BETTER → NEW, always in that order.
