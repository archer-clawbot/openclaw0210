# More, Better, New — Scaling the Core Four

## Core Concept

If you're doing the Core Four but not getting enough leads, there are only three ways to boost any of them: do MORE of it, do it BETTER, or do it somewhere NEW. Apply in this order.

## The Three Levers

### 1. MORE — Increase Volume
The simplest and often biggest lever. Double your inputs = more outputs (even without any improvement).
- Double your reach outs
- Post twice the content
- Double your ad spend
- Run more ads simultaneously

**The Rule of 100:**
Do 100 primary actions per day, for 100 days straight. Non-negotiable commitment.

| Core Four Method | Rule of 100 Application |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Warm Outreach | 100 reach outs/day |
| Post Content | 100 minutes/day creating, minimum 1 post/day |
| Cold Outreach | 100 reach outs/day (use automation) |
| Paid Ads | 100 minutes/day on ads, run for 100 days straight |

### 2. BETTER — Improve Conversion
Getting better = more leads for the same effort. You get better through TESTING.

**How to find what to test:**
Every step a lead takes before becoming a customer is a potential drop-off point. Test the step with the BIGGEST drop-off first (the "constraint").

Example:
- 30% opt-in rate
- 5% apply rate ← CONSTRAINT (biggest drop-off, test this first)
- 50% schedule rate

**Testing framework:**
1. Change ONE variable at a time
2. Run for statistically significant volume
3. If it improves, keep it. If not, toss it.
4. Thousands of tiny tests separate winners from beginners

### 3. NEW — Expand to New Places
After maximizing More and Better on current channels, go somewhere NEW.
- New platforms (Facebook → YouTube → LinkedIn → TikTok)
- New placements within a platform
- New audiences (adjacent niches, different demographics)
- New geographies

**Progression:** New placements → New platforms → New Core Four methods

## Common Mistake: "I've Saturated My Market"

Almost nobody has actually saturated their market. The chiropractor niche example: one business spending $30K/month on ONE platform thought they saturated a $15.1B industry. Meanwhile, a competitor was spending $30K/week across FOUR platforms.

You haven't saturated anything. You've just stopped growing your inputs.

## Decision Framework

Ask in order:
1. Can I do MORE of what's already working? → Do it.
2. Is there a specific step where leads drop off? → Test to make it BETTER.
3. Am I only on one platform/channel? → Expand to somewhere NEW.

## Application

For any underperforming channel, diagnose:
- Volume problem? → MORE
- Conversion problem? → BETTER (find and fix the constraint)
- Channel problem? → NEW (expand to additional platforms)
