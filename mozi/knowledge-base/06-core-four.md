## Core Concept

There are ONLY four ways to let people know about what you sell. Every marketing activity falls into one of these four buckets. If you're not getting enough leads, you're either not doing enough of the Core Four or not doing them well enough.

## The 2×2 Matrix

Two types of audiences × Two types of communication = Four methods

|                    | 1-to-1 (Private)    | 1-to-Many (Public)  |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Warm Audience**  | 1. Warm Outreach    | 2. Post Content     |
| **Cold Audience**  | 3. Cold Outreach    | 4. Paid Ads         |

**Warm audiences** = People who gave you permission to contact them (friends, followers, customers, contacts)
**Cold audiences** = People who haven't given you permission (strangers, bought lists, other peoples' audiences)

## Method 1: Warm Outreach
**What:** Personally reaching out to people who know you
**How:** Calls, texts, DMs, emails to contacts, friends, past clients, followers
**Best for:** Starting from zero, no budget, building first client base
**Key metric:** 100 reach outs per day (Rule of 100)

**The ACA Framework (for warm outreach messages):**
- Acknowledge them personally
- Compliment something specific  
- Ask if they know someone who needs help with [specific problem]

---

## Method 2: Post Free Content
**What:** Publishing content to your warm audience publicly
**How:** Social media posts, videos, podcasts, articles, emails to list
**Best for:** Building authority, nurturing leads, long-term demand generation
**Key metric:** 100 minutes per day making content, minimum 1 piece released daily

**Content creation formula:**
- Hook (stop the scroll)
- Retain (keep their attention)
- Reward (deliver value)

**Content types that work:**
- Lists, steps, stories (short-form)
- Tutorials, case studies, deep dives (long-form)
- Document, don't just create

---

## Method 3: Cold Outreach
**What:** Personally reaching out to strangers
**How:** Cold email, cold DM, cold call, direct mail, door-to-door
**Best for:** Predictable lead generation, scaling beyond warm network
**Key metric:** 100 reach outs per day, use automation for volume

**Cold outreach sequence:**
1. Personalized opener (not "Dear Sir/Madam")
2. Identify their specific problem
3. Offer something valuable for free (lead magnet)
4. Clear call to action
5. Follow up 3-7 times

---

## Method 4: Paid Ads
**What:** Paying platforms to show your message to strangers at scale
**How:** Facebook/Meta ads, Google ads, YouTube, LinkedIn, direct mail, billboards
**Best for:** Scaling proven offers, predictable growth, reaching large audiences
**Key metric:** $100/day minimum, aim for Client Financed Acquisition (CFA)

**Paid ads framework:**
1. Make an ad (creative + copy)
2. Show it to the right people (targeting)
3. Send them somewhere valuable (landing page + lead magnet)
4. Measure and optimize (CAC, ROAS, LTV:CAC)

---

## The Recommended Sequence

Start in this order (least to most capital required):
1. **Warm Outreach** — Free, immediate, builds first revenue
2. **Post Content** — Free, compounds over time, builds authority
3. **Cold Outreach** — Low cost, predictable, scalable
4. **Paid Ads** — Highest cost, highest scale potential

Do NOT skip steps. Each one teaches you skills that make the next one work better.

## Key Insight: Engaged Leads

A "lead" is just a person you can contact. What you actually want is an ENGAGED lead—someone who has shown interest. The output of all advertising is engaged leads. Getting more of them is the entire game.

## Decision Criteria

- No leads at all? Start with Warm Outreach TODAY
- Some leads but inconsistent? Add Content + Cold Outreach
- Proven offer, need scale? Layer on Paid Ads
- Doing all four but still not enough? Apply "More, Better, New" (see separate framework)
