## MESSAGING OVERHAUL

### OLD Homepage:
**"Chicagoland's Most Trusted Electrician"**
→ Generic, unproven, boring

**"Sleep Better Knowing Your Home's Electrical System Is Safe for the Next 5 Years—Guaranteed, or Your Money Back"**

**Subhead:**
"Join 500+ Chicago families who never worry about electrical emergencies again"

**CTA:**
"Get Your Free Electrical Safety Score" → Scorecard quiz

## SALES PROCESS

### New Funnel:

1. **Lead Magnet:** Safety Scorecard (online quiz)
   - Captures: email, phone, address, risk level
   - Output: Personalized score + recommended next step

2. **Qualification Call:** 
   - NOT "what do you need?"
   - ASK: "Tell me about your home and what concerns you"
   - Present appropriate package
   - Book "Safety Audit" (not "estimate")

3. **In-Home Safety Audit:**
   - 42-point inspection
   - Document with photos
   - Present findings with priority rankings
   - Frame as "safety plan" not "service quote"

4. **Package Presentation:**
   - Show value stack (not line items)
   - Lead with Elite (anchor high)
   - Position Upgrade as "most popular"
   - Highlight guarantee prominently
   - Use objection handling scripts

5. **Close or Nurture:**
   - If yes: Onboard immediately
   - If no: Add to nurture sequence (3-5-7-14-30 day follow-up)

**Expected close rate:** 30% → 55%

## OBJECTION HANDLING CHEAT SHEET

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| **"Too expensive"** | "The average emergency costs $2,500-5,000. Our plan eliminates that risk for 5 years. That's $83/month for complete peace of mind. What's it worth to know your family is safe?" |
| **"Need other quotes"** | "Absolutely. But ask them: 'What happens if I have a problem 6 months from now?' We'll still be here with our 5-year guarantee." |
| **"My system is fine"** | "That's what 73% think—until they have a problem. Electrical issues are silent until they're expensive or dangerous. Take the 60-second Safety Scorecard. At least you'll know." |
| **"Can't afford it"** | "Start with Foundation at $2,497. We'll identify priorities and spread work over 6-12 months with payment plans." |
| **"I'll call when I have a problem"** | "You could. Then you pay emergency rates ($200+/hr) while stressed. Our members skip that—priority service, lower rates, better sleep. Like oil changes vs. waiting for engine failure." |
