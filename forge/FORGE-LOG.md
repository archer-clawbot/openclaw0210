# Night Forge — Institutional Memory

<!--
This file is Forge's memory of past problems, fixes, and outcomes.
Forge reads this at the start of each nightly cycle to:
1. Detect repeat issues (escalate priority if seen 3+ nights)
2. Avoid re-applying failed fixes
3. Track improvement trends
-->

<!-- Entries will be appended below by Forge during nightly cycles -->
