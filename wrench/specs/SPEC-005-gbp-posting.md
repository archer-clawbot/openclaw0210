# SPEC-005: GBP Posting Strategy
## Silas Engine — Route 1: GBP Optimization Pipeline
### Version 1.0 | GBP Optimization Group

## 1. PURPOSE

This specification defines Silas's GBP posting cadence, content strategy, and the "Pre-Emptive Framing" technique. GBP posts are not promotional flyers — they are content units that seed Google's index and AI systems with keyword-rich, authority-building signals. The strategy frames the business as the market-defining authority that sets the standard competitors are measured against.

**Core principle:** "Don't tell people you're the best. Define what 'best' means, then demonstrate you meet the criteria."

## 3. PRE-EMPTIVE FRAMING

### 3.1 The Concept

Pre-emptive framing means defining the evaluation criteria for your industry BEFORE the customer has formed their own criteria. When a post says "When choosing a plumber, look for: ✅ Licensed Master Plumber, ✅ Same-day availability, ✅ Transparent pricing" — the business is setting the rules of comparison in its favor.

### 3.2 Why It Works

```
Customer sees framing post → Internalizes criteria → Evaluates all businesses against those criteria
     ↓                                                            ↓
Your business meets all criteria (because you defined them) → Chosen over competitors
     ↓
Competitors who don't meet YOUR criteria → Appear deficient by comparison
```

### 3.3 Framing vs. Promotion

| Promotional (weak) | Pre-Emptive Framing (strong) |
|--------------------|------------------------------|
| "We're the best plumber in Sugar Land!" | "When choosing a plumber, licensed Master Plumber status is essential." |
| "50% off first visit!" | "What to expect from a quality salon experience: [criteria you meet]" |
| "Call now!" | "5 questions to ask before hiring a contractor in [city]" |

## 4. POSTING CADENCE

### 4.1 Schedule

**Minimum:** 3 posts per week
**Optimal:** 5 posts per week (weekdays)
**Maximum:** 1 per day (more than daily dilutes impact)

### 4.2 Weekly Rotation

| Day | Post Type | Focus |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| **Monday** | Service Highlight | Feature a specific service with expertise detail |
| **Tuesday** | Pre-Emptive Frame | "How to choose..." or "What to look for..." content |
| **Wednesday** | Community/Local | Local event, partnership, neighborhood mention |
| **Thursday** | Social Proof | Review highlight, before/after, case study |
| **Friday** | Offer/Event/Seasonal | Weekend special, upcoming event, seasonal service |

### 4.3 Content Calendar Generation

Silas generates a 4-week content calendar per client:

```
Week 1:
- Mon: Service A highlight (primary keyword cluster)
- Tue: Pre-emptive frame targeting Service A evaluation criteria
- Wed: Community post mentioning [Local Entity]
- Thu: Review showcase for Service A
- Fri: Weekend offer or seasonal content

Week 2:
- Mon: Service B highlight (secondary keyword cluster)
- Tue: Pre-emptive frame for Service B criteria
- Wed: Neighborhood spotlight [Neighborhood Name]
- Thu: Before/after or case study
- Fri: Event promotion or seasonal content

[...rotate through all services over 4 weeks...]
```

## 5. POST TEMPLATES

### 5.1 Service Highlight Post

```
[Service Name] in [City] — What to Know in [Year]

[2-3 sentences positioning the business as expert on this service. Include 
specific details: pricing range, process overview, timeline, or materials used.]

[Credential or trust signal: certification, years of experience, manufacturer 
authorization.]

[CTA: Call, book, or visit]
📞 [Phone] | 🌐 [Website]
```

### 5.2 Pre-Emptive Framing Post

```
When choosing a [service provider] in [city], look for:

✅ [Credential your client has — e.g., "Licensed and insured"]
✅ [Feature your client offers — e.g., "Same-day availability"]
✅ [Trust signal your client possesses — e.g., "Transparent, upfront pricing"]
✅ [Differentiator — e.g., "Manufacturer-certified technicians"]

[Business Name] meets all of these — [brief proof statement with number].

📞 [Phone] for a free consultation.
```

### 5.3 Community/Local Post

```
[Business Name] is proud to [support/partner with/attend] [Local Entity/Event].

[1-2 sentences about the connection — why this relationship matters to the community.]

[Tag or mention the local entity by full name for co-citation value.]

[Optional: photo from the event/partnership]
```

### 5.4 Social Proof Post

```
⭐ [Star rating] from [Reviewer First Name] in [Neighborhood]:

"[1-2 sentence review excerpt — choose the most keyword-rich review text]"

Thank you, [Name]! [1 sentence response highlighting the specific service mentioned 
in the review.]

[CTA: Ready for the same experience? Call [phone].]
```

### 5.5 Query Coupon Post (Advanced)

A "query coupon" embeds a specific search query into post content, making Google associate the business with that query:

```
Searching for "[exact target keyword]" in [city]? Here's what [Business Name] 
offers:

[3-4 bullet points with specific service details that answer the implied query]

[Credential] | [Phone] | [CTA]
```

## 6. POST CONTENT RULES

### 6.1 Must Include
- At least one geo-modifier per post (city, neighborhood, or area name)
- A clear CTA (call, visit, book — never leave a post without an action)
- A real photo (not stock, not AI-generated — real business photos)
- The business name at least once

### 6.2 Must Vary
- Keywords across posts (don't target the same keyword every post)
- Post types across the week (no two consecutive same-type posts)
- Photos (different image for each post, never repeat the same photo)
- Service focus (rotate through all services over the monthly calendar)

### 6.3 Must Avoid
- Thin content (under 50 words per post)
- Excessive hashtags (GBP is not Instagram — 0-2 hashtags max)
- Link building attempts (posts are for content seeding, not backlinks)
- Identical posts across multiple locations (each location needs unique content)
- Promotional language without substance ("BEST DEAL EVER!!")
- Posts without images (image posts get significantly more visibility)

---

## 7. MULTI-LOCATION POSTING

For clients with multiple locations:

### 7.1 Unique Content Per Location
Each location must have its own posting calendar with:
- Location-specific community mentions
- Neighborhood-specific geographic references
- Location-specific review highlights
- Different photos from that specific location

### 7.2 Shared Elements
- Brand voice and tone can be consistent
- Service highlight topics can be shared (but with location-specific details)
- Pre-emptive framing structure can be templated (but with location-specific fills)

---

## 8. SCORING RUBRIC

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **0** | No posts, or last post > 60 days ago. |
| **1** | Sporadic posting (1-2 per month), generic content. |
| **2** | Monthly posting but no strategy, mostly promotional. |
| **3** | 1-2 posts per week, some keyword targeting, inconsistent. |
| **4** | 2-3 posts per week, mixed quality, no pre-emptive framing. |
| **5** | 3 posts per week consistently, basic keyword optimization. |
| **6** | 3+ posts per week, some pre-emptive framing, local entity mentions. |
| **7** | 3+ per week, full pre-emptive framing strategy, local entity mentions, varied post types. |
| **8** | 5 per week, complete rotation through all services, community posts, review highlights, query coupons. |
| **9** | Score 8 + consistent for 2+ months, measurable ranking improvements. |
| **10** | 5 per week, all post types deployed, pre-emptive framing across all services, consistent 3+ months, tracked impact on geo-grid rankings. |

## 9. AUTOMATION PIPELINE

```
TRIGGER: New client onboarded OR monthly calendar generation cycle

1. AUDIT current posting history (frequency, quality, topics covered)
2. SCORE current state (Section 8)
3. GENERATE 4-week content calendar:
   a. MAP all services to weekly rotation
   b. IDENTIFY local entities for community posts
   c. SELECT top reviews for social proof posts
   d. CREATE pre-emptive framing content for each service area
   e. GENERATE full post text for every calendar entry
4. FORMAT deliverable as a ready-to-schedule calendar
5. DELIVER to operator for posting (or schedule via API if available)
6. REPEAT monthly

ESCALATION POINTS:
- Photos needed from client → provide shot list with specific requirements
- Review selection needs client approval → flag sensitive reviews
- Local events/partnerships → request operator input on community connections
- API posting access → if GBP API posting is available, Silas can schedule directly
```
