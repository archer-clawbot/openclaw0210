What if I told you that building a


website in about 10 minutes could


realistically make you $2 to $5,000


every single month, not from ads or


views, but by helping local businesses


that already need this. So around 60% of


small businesses still have outdated


websites or no website at all. So that


gap is the opportunity and it's exactly


where this business model fits. So, in


this video, I'm going to show you how to


find clients who genuinely need your


help, how to build professional websites


in minutes using Base 44, and the


strategies that actually work when it


comes to closing deals. I'll also show


you how to turn simple website builds


into ongoing monthly retainers that can


realistically reach $5,000 or more. And


the reason this works is Base 44. Its AI


lets you move fast and produce


professional results without dealing


with the usual headaches of WordPress,


Wix, or custom coding. And with over


400,000 users already using it, Base 44


makes this approach scalable and


practical, even if you're just getting


started. So, all right, let's get into


it. So, first things first, I've added a


special link to Bass 44 in the


description below. So, when you join B4


through my link, you'll get free access


to the B44 master class where you're


going to learn how to build and sell


websites, apps, and SAS businesses. Now,


normally this master class costs 299


bucks, but if you're watching this


video, you can join completely free


using the link below. So, let's start


with one of the easiest ways to find


local business clients, and that's


Google Maps. Once you know what to look


for, it's a gold mine. So, I'm going to


open up Google Maps here and search for


something like plumbers near me, right?


Since I am in Amsterdam, I'm going to


search for plumbers in Amsterdam. And


I'm going to scroll through the listings


on the map. And what we're looking for


are businesses that don't have a real


website or are relying on something


like, let's say, Facebook Marketplace


instead. So, when you click into a


listing, check the website button. If


there's no site or it links to social


media, that's a strong signal they need


help. In more competitive cities, it can


be harder to find businesses with no


website at all. Most plumbers I found


already had sites which actually shows


just how important SEO is. And even so,


if a listing doesn't clearly show a


proper website, that's still an


opportunity. So, as I go through these


results, I'm tracking everything in a


simple Google sheet. Business name,


their contact info, website status, and


review count. Nothing too fancy, just


enough to stay organized. I'm also going


to quickly check their existing website


if they have one because outdated


designs, broken links, or sites that


haven't been updated in years are all


still great opportunities. Reviews


matter, too. Businesses with around 20


to 100 reviews are usually established,


active, and able to afford ongoing


services. So, once you start doing this


consistently, you're going to realize


how many solid opportunities are just


sitting there on Google Maps waiting for


someone to reach out. Once you do have a


list of businesses, the next question is


simple. What do you actually say? So,


the good news is that you don't need to


say anything fancy or salesy. Simple


direct messages work best for businesses


that already have a website. The angle


is improvement. You're not criticizing,


you're showing initiative. A message


like this works well. Hey, business


name. I noticed a few things on your


website that are easy to fix. I built a


new version optimized for more leads.


You want to take a look? And for


businesses without a website, it's even


more straightforward here. Something


like this. Hey, business name. I was


looking for your website, but I couldn't


find one, so I built one for you. Would


you want to check it out? And the key


here is leading with value. You're not


asking if they want help. You're already


showing them something that already


exists. And you can tweak this slightly


by industry, too. So, for restaurants,


for example, focus on convenience. Hi,


restaurant name. I noticed Kasa Mexico


doesn't have online ordering. I built a


quick system where customers can order


from their phones. Do you want to see


it? And for real estate, you can focus


on leads and credibility. So for fitness


studios, you can focus on bookings. The


structure stays the same. You notice a


problem, you build a solution, and then


you just ask permission to show it. As


for delivery, email, social DMs, phone


calls, and even inerson outreach, all


those can work. The channel matters less


than the message. And if you keep it


simple and value first, these scripts


work across the board. Prospecting


social media is another strong way to


find clients as long as you don't treat


it like spam. Now, the goal here is to


be personal, observant, and helpful.


Instagram is a great place to start.


Look up local businesses like


landscaping companies and then scan


their profiles. And a lot of them post


great work, but have outdated bios,


broken website links, or no clear call


to action. And that is your opening.


Instead of pitching, send something more


personal like, "Hey, business name. I


love the work you did on whatever


project that was. I noticed your website


link isn't working, so I built a quick


mockup for your business that captures


leads automatically. Mind if I share it


with you?" And because this message is


specific and it is value first, it


doesn't feel salesy. Approaches like


this often get response rates in the 30


to 40% range, which is far higher than


generic cold DMs. Facebook works well,


too, especially local business and


community groups. When business owners


post about needing a website update or


losing customers, well, then you can


offer a free mockup that shows how a


modern site solves their problem, and


that positions you as helpful, not


pushy. LinkedIn is best for B2B services


like consultants, coaches, and


accountants. After connecting, a simple


follow-up like this helps. I help


profession capture more qualified leads


through automated systems. Would a


10-minute mockup for your business be


useful? That works well because it


focuses on ROI and efficiency. A simple


conversational message often performs


best. So again, when you lead with value


and you show a real mockup, reply rates


around 30 to 35% are common and many of


those conversations turn into discovery


calls. But not everything has to happen


online. Some of the best clients come


from simply showing up locally and


having real face-to-face conversations.


Chamber of Commerce events and local


networking mixers are a great place to


start. These are full of business owners


who are already open to meeting people


and you don't need a complex pitch. You


just need something simple that works


like this. I help local businesses


capture leads they're currently losing.


Would you like to see what I built for a


similar business? And then from a single


event, it's realistic to collect the say


five to 10 contacts. And the key is


following up within 24 hours with


something personalized, ideally a quick


mockup. Referral partnerships are


another strong channel too. So think web


designers who are overloaded or


marketing agencies that need fast


execution or consultants whose clients


need websites. So instead of competing,


you become their go-to solution.


Offering a 20 to 30% commission on


recurring revenue gives them a clear


incentive to send clients your way. You


can also create visibility. Wearing a


shirt like I build websites in 15


minutes. Ask me how. At things like


coffee shops or co-working spaces


naturally sparks conversations and


removes cold outreach altogether. And


finally, there's the doortodoor approach


for high value prospects. This works


best for businesses with clearly


outdated websites. You just show up with


an iPad, pull up the current site, then


show a quick mockup that you built, and


then you ask them, "What do you think?"


Now, that combination of in-person


presence and immediate value converts


surprisingly well. So, now that we've


covered how to find clients, let's go


ahead and build a website in Base 44.


After you create an account and you log


in, you'll land on the dashboard here.


And this is where all of your projects


live and where you start new builds.


From there, you jump into the AI


generation screen. Describe what you


want, and then B 44 creates the


structure for you. A quick note here, B


44 has websites and apps. Websites are


for business sites, landing pages, and


portfolios. Apps are for interactive


builds like booking systems or ordering


flows. For most local clients, you'll


mostly stick to websites here. You also


get templates and quick customization


tools, so you can adjust the layout, the


colors, and content to match a client's


brand fast without having to write any


code. Choose a real local business, for


example, a landscaping company. And for


this demo, I'm going to use a real local


business as an example. Again, a


landscaping company. I'm going to search


for landscaping companies in Amsterdam.


And then let's just go ahead and pick


one at random. So even though this


business already has a website, I'm not


going to copy it. Instead, I'm going to


ask B 44 to generate a fresh mock


website first, and then we'll layer in


the company's details after. So now I'm


going to let Base 44 generate the first


version of the site. In the prompt box


here, I'm going to keep it simple and


I'm going to type in please create a


simple website for a landscaping


company. And once I hit generate, you


can see base 44 start building it in


real time. And it kicks off immediately


and begins putting the structure


together. Now, what's happening here is


pretty straightforward. Base 44 takes


that natural language prompt and then


translate it into an actual website


build. So, you get a usable starting


point without having to design


everything from scratch. So right now


the goal is to turn this mock site into


something that actually looks like it


belongs to a real business. So this is


where we replace all the placeholder


content with the company's real


branding, their services and contact


details. And for this part, I'm going to


use a prompt like this. Please revamp


our website's data and get the data from


this website to replace it. And it's


going to be on your screen here with the


URL. Please update the logo and ensure


the contact information as well as


placeholder content we have is the same


as their services. Lastly, please ensure


that the website is 100% mobile


responsive. So after running that


prompt, you can see base 44 pull data


from that existing website and then


apply it directly to our build. So the


logo and the branding are updated, the


placeholder content is replaced with our


actual services and the correct contact


information and location are added as


well. The site also ends up being fully


mobile responsive, so it looks clean and


it's usable on phones without any extra


manual adjustments. A lot of websites


look fine at first glance, but don't


actually do anything for the business.


They're online, but they don't bring in


calls or messages or leads, which kind


of defeats the point, right? So, this


part is all about making sure the site


isn't just good-looking, but actually


effective. And to help with that, I'm


going to ask B4 to optimize the


website's SEO by using a simple prompt


like this. Please optimize the SEO for


its location. And from there, you can


see the core features that every local


business website should have. And the


contact information here is clear and


easy to find, including phone number,


email, and address. Service descriptions


are laid out clearly with pricing


included where it makes sense. The site


also highlights customer testimonials


and reviews which are huge for trust,


especially with local businesses. Now,


combined with the mobile friendly layout


we looked at earlier, the site loads


quickly and it works smoothly on phones.


On top of that, the locationbased SEO


helps the business show up in local


searches and clear call toaction buttons


and contact forms make it easy for


visitors to reach out or request a


quote. All these pieces together are


what turn a simple website into


something that actually brings in leads.


If you've built websites before, you


know most of the time isn't spent


designing. It's actually spent on setup


and fixes and maintenance. And that's


where B 44 stands out. The biggest


difference is speed. With B 44, you can


go from a prompt to a fully functional


client ready website in about say 10 to


15 minutes. WordPress usually takes what


2 to four hours just for hosting themes


and plugins and custom coding can take


20 to 40 hours for a basic site. So when


the time it takes to build one WordPress


site, you can build several base 44


mock-ups by then. Hosting and


maintenance are built in. There's no


server setup, no plugins to manage, and


no updates to babysit. So when you do


publish changes, they go live


immediately, which makes managing


multiple clients much easier. Design


quality is another advantage, too. Base


44 produces clean, modern websites with


good spacing and mobile responsiveness,


as you've seen, and solid typography,


too. The results look professional and


don't feel cheap like some templates.


They easily compete with sites that


would normally cost a few thousand. And


all of this makes B 44 scalable because


builds and updates take minutes, not


hours. One person can realistically


manage 10, 20 clients at once. Instead


of dealing with technical overhead, your


time goes into client work and growth,


which is what makes this a sustainable


business model. One of the easiest ways


to get clients to say yes is to show the


work before you ever ask for money. And


that's the idea behind the free website


mockup. And this works because people


aren't imagining what their business


could look like. They're actually seeing


it right now before their eyes. So when


someone receives something valuable


upfront, it creates immediate buyin and


trust. The only reason this is possible


is speed. With Base 44, you can actually


build a solid mockup in 10 to 15


minutes. Now, here I'm going to show you


examples using simple prompts like


create a website for a fitness gym or


create a website for a manufacturing


plant. Then quickly layer in the


branding, the services, and key


features. And once the mockup is ready,


the follow-up stays simple. Send a live


link with something like this. I spent


15 minutes building this for whatever


the business name is. What do you think?


And after sending that out, wait a day


or two so that space keeps it natural


and avoids any pressure. And if they're


interested, shift into discovery instead


of pricing. Ask what they actually want.


More leads, better customer experiences,


or smoother operations. And then connect


those goals to what you can deliver. And


this works because you're not pitching


an idea. you're already showing


something that they've already seen and


started to value. The biggest pricing


mistakes is charging one-time fees and


then moving on. Monthly pricing works


better for you and for the client, and


it's easier to justify. The first tier


is a basic website and hosting package,


usually like $150 to $200 per month. And


this covers a professional mobile


responsive site, hosting, security, and


basic updates. You position it as their


digital storefront that runs 24/7


without them worrying about tech. And


the second tier adds lead capture and


automation, typically $3 to $500 per


month. This includes contact forms,


email capture, simple CRM tracking, and


automated follow-ups. The key feature


here is framing lost opportunity. Even


one extra customer per month often pays


for the service itself. And the third


tier is full marketing automation,


usually$1 to $2,000 per month, aimed at


more established businesses. This


includes booking systems, dashboards,


email campaigns, analytics, and


integrations. The value is time savings,


and efficiency. If it saves them hours


every week, the pricing makes sense.


Monthly pricing works because it lowers


friction. A few hundred per month feels


a lot more manageable, creates ongoing


relationships, and makes ROI


conversations simple. You're no longer a


one-off website builder. You're a


long-term partner. One of the most


effective questions you can ask a


business owner is simple. Something like


this. When was the last time you updated


your website? And most small businesses


haven't touched their site in years. And


when they hesitate, you've already


surfaced a problem there. without


pitching anything. You're not selling.


You're not diagnosing. The reason this


works is because it's non-threatening.


You're just asking for information, not


pushing a service. Their answer


naturally reveals issues like outdated


design or missing features or mobile


problems or a site that doesn't generate


leads. One strong follow-up is, "Well,


if you could change one thing about it,


what would it be?" From there, you can


guide the conversation with valuebased


questions like, "How many customers find


you through your website versus word of


mouth highlights missed opportunities?"


Or, "What happens when someone fills out


your contact form exposes broken


processes?" Or, "Do you know how many


visitors don't contact you, which then


shows a lack of visibility?" Objections


will come up, of course, and that's


normal. If they say it's too expensive,


bring it back to value. How much is one


new customer worth? And if they say they


don't need a website, then you can ask,


"Where do people go when they want to


verify that you're legitimate?" If they


say they'll do it themselves, you can


say, "How long have you been planning


to? What if it was done next week?" And


these questions work because they don't


pressure anyone. They're just surfacing


real problems and then letting the


business owner arrive at the conclusion


on their own, which is far more


effective than trying to push and sell


them. So once you understand their


situation, how you explain your offer


matters. And the key shift here is


simple. Just stop talking about features


and start talking about outcomes.


Instead of saying responsive design or


database integration, just translate


that into results. So for example,


customers can book appointments from


their phone at 2 a.m. and you can wake


up to a full calendar or every inquiry


goes into one dashboard so no leads get


lost. A powerful question to anchor the


conversation is, "How much is one new


customer worth to you?" And then


whatever number they give becomes your


reference point. So if they say $2,000,


you respond with, "So if this system


brings you just one extra customer every


couple of months, it already pays for


itself." And then from there, just keep


the math simple. So you're getting about


20 visitors a month with no capture


system. That likely means you're losing


around 10 potential customers. At $2,000


each, that's $20,000 in missed revenue.


If a $400 monthly system captures even


25% of that, you're adding $5,000 per


month. So, this works because you're not


selling. You're just laying out the


numbers. When the math is clear, the


decision is easy. Once the website is


live, this is where it starts to scale.


These features turn a simple site into a


real business system and opens the door


to higher value upselles. One of the


first upgrades is lead capture and then


follow-up. So here I ask B 44 to expand


the contact form and add automation.


Please update the contact form, create


an automated email system that sends a


confirmation email if the user triggers


the contact form. Also build a login


page and make a dashboard to keep track


of users that submit the form. Create


options in the dashboard to send booking


confirmation emails and mark bookings as


confirmed, completed, or cancelled. So,


this replaces basic contact forms with a


simple workflow instead. Leads are


tracked, confirmations are automatic,


and nothing gets lost. You can also


layer in appointment bookings on the


same dashboard, too, allowing bookings


to be confirmed, completed, or


cancelled. And for service businesses,


this alone saves time and prevents


missed opportunities. For more advanced


setups, these systems can connect to CRM


or marketing tools. And the key point is


that once leads are structured,


automation becomes really easy. And this


is where pricing naturally increases,


too, because you're no longer just


selling a website. You're selling


automation, organization, and time


savings. Another powerful upgrade is


adding an AI chat widget to the website.


So, I'm going to ask base 44 to do this


with a simple prompt. Please create an


AI chatbot for our website. Users should


be able to talk to the chatbot to


discuss general info about the business.


And after that, the chatbot can hold


full conversations on its own. It


answers common questions, explains


services, and helps visitors get the


information they're looking for without


the business owner actually needing to


be involved. And anyone who engages with


the chatbot is already showing intent,


which then means they can be treated as


a lead. Even if they don't fill out a


contact form, that interaction alone


signals interest. So, the big advantage


here is availability. The chatbot works


24/7 and while the business owner is


busy or maybe asleep, the site is still


responding, helping customers and


capturing opportunities. And for busy


business owners, this completely changes


how their website works. So instead of


being a passive brochure, it becomes an


active salesperson answering questions


instantly, qualifying leads and


capturing interest around the clock


without needing any additional staff or


breaks or follow-ups. A website is


useful, but for local businesses, being


found is what actually matters, and


that's where local SEO comes in. So to


show this, I'm going to run an SEO


optimization prompt in B 44 based on the


business details and location. Please


further optimize the website's SEO based


on the new info we added, especially for


the area or region it's in. So this


prompt helps the site rank for local


searches like service near me or service


in say Amsterdam. Google My Business


setup takes time because it requires


verification. So I'm not doing it live


here. The important part is that once


the base 44 site is published, you can


just use that link directly when


creating or optimizing a Google business


profile. The website becomes the


foundation that everything points to. So


reviews and local citations are the


final pieces. Making reviews visible


builds trust and listings on platforms


like Google and Yelp and local


directories improve credibility. Even a


short setup can drive organic traffic


that would otherwise cost hundreds per


month in ads. So here you're going to


move from building websites to acting as


a marketing partner, helping businesses


show up and get contacted. So right now


base 44 doesn't have builtin


functionality to directly connect social


media accounts and automate posting or


pull in social proof using native


platform integrations. I tried this and


even consulted with B 44 directly and


those kinds of features require a full


web app setup with official SDKs from


platforms like Instagram and Facebook or


X. So that said, this doesn't limit the


business model nearly as much as it


might sound and instead of thinking


about B 44 as a social media tool, it's


better to think of it as the central hub


for everything else. So the website


becomes the one place every platform


just points to. social media, Google


ads, email campaigns, and any other


traffic source the business uses. So,


when someone clicks a link from


Instagram, Google, or an email, they


just land on the base 44 website that's


optimized for conversions, lead capture,


and followup. And that's where the real


value is here. Social platforms drive


attention, but the website is where


leads actually get captured and


organized. This is also how you position


yourself as more than just a website


builder because you're not managing


isolated tools. You're helping


businesses connect all of their


marketing efforts into one system. So,


every post, every ad, every campaign,


sends traffic to a site that actually


converts, that tracks inquiries, and


supports follow-up. And that integrated


approach makes ROI much easier to


explain, justifies higher monthly fees,


and makes you harder to replace. So,


you're not just building a website. No,


you're managing the foundation of their


entire digital presence. So, here I'm


going to start with Lovable and focus


mainly on speed and first impressions.


To test it out, we're going to ask


Lovable to create a simple website using


this prompt. Please create a simple


website for a local farm business. After


running the prompt, you can see that


Lovable moves pretty quickly. In this


case, it generated the website in say


about 2 and 1/2 minutes or so, which is


genuinely fast. I scroll through the


site here and visually it looks good.


The layout is clean, the sections make


sense, and for a design focused site, it


does build a solid job right out of the


gate. And from a usability standpoint,


Lovable feels intuitive. You prompt it,


it builds, and you immediately get


something that you can review and tweak.


While I'm not pulling from a specific


community thread here, the general


sentiment around Lovable is that it's


fast and straightforward, especially for


quickly generating good-looking designs.


I didn't do a deep template comparison


in this section, but based on speed and


initial output alone, Lovable performs


well for design first websites. And for


this part, I'm going to rate Lovable


around an eight out of 10. It's


genuinely fast and produces


solid-looking sites quickly, especially


if your main priority is visual design


and rapid generation. Next, let's go


ahead and run the same test using Base


44 with the exact same prompt. And Base


44 completes the build in about 2


minutes, which is a little bit faster.


But the bigger difference here is what


it produces. This isn't just a visual


layout. The site comes with working


functionality behind it. And you can see


that when I publish the project,


everything is already set up and live


without requiring users to log in or any


extra configuration. So by default, from


the get- go, B4 builds websites with


back-end functionality already in place.


So forms and workflows and interactions


actually work out of the box. This is


where B4 really stands out. It's not


just generating a nicel looking design


and that's it. Nope. It's building


something a real business can actually


use right away. And because of that, I'm


going to rate Base 44 a 9 out of 10.


It's fast, but more importantly, it


builds complete business solutions, not


just pretty websites. For this part, I


am going to ask Lovable directly what


native integrations it supports by using


this prompt. What other native


integrations can you support? Please


give me accounts and the list. So, based


on its response, Lovable here currently


supports around 16 native integrations


and that gives a decent amount of


flexibility. Yes, especially for simpler


use cases. Where Lovable really shines


is on the design and front-end side.


It's great at producing polished user


interfaces and clean client-f facing


experiences. And that said, Lovable is


still primarily front-end focused. It


doesn't offer the same level of built-in


back-end infrastructure or complex


database handling or advanced business


logic. For anything involving deeper


workflows, automation, or data heavy


systems, you're likely going to need


external tools, or custom development to


fill in those gaps. And because of that,


I'm going to give Lovable's built-in


functionality around a 6 out of 10. It's


great for design again, but you'll need


additional tools if you're building full


business systems. So, now let's go ahead


and take a look at Base 44's built-in


functionality. You can see the back-end


features directly here. Base 44 includes


a native database by default. And if an


app requires user login, users are


automatically tracked. Even though this


demo is mostly static, the full


infrastructure, the database, the user


handling, and the business logic, it's


already here in place. The key


difference is that none of this needs to


be wired together manually. Base 44


doesn't stop at generating a front end.


The back end exists automatically, and


you only use what you need. So if an app


doesn't require login, still works and


if it does, everything is already set up


for you. There are also community


discussions that highlight how flexible


B4 is when scaling applications with


most feedback pointing to the same


advantage here. Backend functionality is


handled for you instead of being added


later on. While public case studies are


still limited, one real example is chart


detector.ai, AI which has been featured


in a business insider and that shows B


44 can support real production level


applications because core business


features like databases, authentication,


workflows, and logic are included out of


the box. I'm going to rate B 44 a 10 out


of 10 here. It's not just a website


builder. It's a full business ready


platform. So, one thing that often gets


overlooked is what happens after the


site is built. specifically how easy it


is for a client to take over and make


changes on their own. So in that regard,


you can see here the full lovable


interface from the client's perspective.


Everything is accessible in one place


and once you understand how it works,


it's definitely usable. Now that said,


the interface can feel a bit


intimidating at first, especially for


non-technical users. While Lovable is


marketed as beginnerfriendly, there is


still a learning curve. Non-technical


users still need to understand how to


structure prompts properly, how the AI


responds to instructions, and how to


troubleshoot when the output isn't quite


right. And that usually comes from trial


and error, not instant intuition. You


can also see community discussions where


beginners share their early experiences


with lovable, which shows that new users


usually need some time to get


comfortable with the platform. So then


this becomes something to keep in mind


when handing it off to your clients.


Overall, Lovable works well for a client


handoff if you're willing to spend some


time onboarding and training. And


because of that, I'm going to rate it a


7 out of 10. Client handoffs look very


different with B 44. And that mostly


comes down to who the interface is


designed for. So here you can see B 44's


user interface, and the first thing that


stands out is how lightweight and


approachable it feels. The layout is


cleaner, the theme is lighter, and


there's less visual clutter overall. So,


compared to Lovable, it's much easier


for non-technical users to understand


where to click, and what they're allowed


to change. So, here, Base 44 is clearly


built with business owners in mind.


Clients can update text, images, and


content through simple forms instead of


editing layouts or rewriting prompts.


They can view and manage database


entries without needing any SQL


knowledge and make basic workflow


changes through conversational prompts


rather than technical configurations.


And because of that, routine updates


don't require a developer. Clients can


pretty much handle everyday changes all


by themselves. Things like updating


services, changing contact details, or


managing leads, all without breaking


anything or feeling overwhelmed. And


that ease of use makes B 44 much easier


to hand off and maintain long term. So


for client-f facing management and


ongoing maintenance, I'm going to give


Base 44 a score here of 9 out of 10. Now


pricing matters if you're planning to


scale this into a business. Lovable's


pro plan costs $25 per month or about


$21 annually with roughly 150 credits


per month. The business plan is 50 bucks


per month or $42 annually, adding


features like SSO and stronger data


privacy controls. So, a typical client


website uses around 20 to 40 credits,


which is only $5 to $10 in build costs.


So, if you're charging clients $300 to


$500 per month, margins can be very high


on paper. But the catch here is back-end


usage costs. Lovable uses usagebased


billing for back-end services. So, as


traffic or data grows, monthly expenses


can increase. In some cases, that can


add $50 to 200 plus per month, making


costs less predictable. Overall,


Lovable's pricing is reasonable upfront,


but back-end add-ons can reduce margins


and scale. I'm going to give it a 7 out


of 10 here. Base 44 takes a different


approach to pricing, and it is one of


its strengths. Plans range from free up


to about $160 per month with everything


already bundled in and that includes the


database, the authentication, hosting,


analytics, file storage, email, and


autogenerated API. So there's no need to


stitch together separate services. So,


this all-in-one setup significantly


reduces cost because now you're not


paying extra for tools like Superbase,


Versel, Authority email providers, which


can easily add a h 100red bucks per


month more in a traditional setup. With


Base 44, one subscription replaces all


of that. It also makes pricing


predictable. There are no surprise usage


fees or multiple subscriptions to manage


as you do scale, which matters when


you're running this as a business. Also,


community feedback supports this. Base


44 is often praised as good value for


money with a 4.9 out of five rating on


Product Hunt and users highlighting its


clean, predictable development flow. And


because of that, I'm going to give B 44


an 8 out of 10 on pricing and


profitability. It may look more


expensive at first, but the bundled


features do offer better overall value.


When scaling as an agency, the key


question is how well a platform handles


multiple clients and projects. Lovable


offers a wide range of reusable


templates, making it easy to spin up new


projects quickly, especially for design


focused work. Community feedback on


scalability is kind of mixed. Some users


report smooth growth, while others note


limitations once projects require more


complex back-end logic or workflows.


Lovable also supports team collaboration


through shared workspaces. Teammates can


view, edit, and publish projects


together with paid plans offering


role-based permissions. Overall, Lovable


scales well for design and


front-endheavy agencies. For more


complex business applications, however,


it can feel limiting without extra


tools. So, I'm going to give it a 7 out


of 10 here for scalability. And


scalability is where B 44 really stands


out for agencies. You can see here B


44's built-in templates and how easily


an existing website can be turned into a


reusable template. Even without


publishing it, the process is simple and


clearly designed for reuse across


multiple clients. So the key advantage


here is that templates carry


functionality, not just design. Forms,


dashboards, and workflows can all be


reused with minimal changes. Once you


build something once, you're not


starting from scratch again. Even


without showing multiple advanced apps


live, the structure makes the scaling


potential obvious. You refine, you


reuse, and adapt instead of rebuilding


every time. Because of its template


system and built-in backend, base 44 is


well suited for managing multiple


business applications. And for that


reason, I'm going to give it a 9 out of


10 for scalability. It's built for


scaling real business solutions, not


just one-off websites. So, at the end of


the day here, this is a simple


opportunity. Local businesses still need


help. AI tools lower the barrier to


entry, and recurring revenue beats


one-off work every single time. So,


going into 2026, the timing couldn't be


better here. Businesses are falling


behind online, while tools like Base 44


let one person deliver professional


results faster than ever. So there's a


saying like the best time to plant an


apple tree was yesterday. The second


best time is today. So what you build


now compounds client skills, income, and


freedom. So don't wait any longer. Start


with one mockup, reach out to one


business, and learn as you go. And if
