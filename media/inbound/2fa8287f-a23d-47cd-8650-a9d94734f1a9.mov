New free anti-gravity AI video agent is


insane. You're wasting hours writing


code line by line. You're stuck in


endless debug loops. Your AI tools just


suggest code while you do all the work.


There's a better way and it literally


records videos of itself testing your


apps. Hey everyone, it's Amelia and I


need to talk about something that


dropped in November 2025 that's


completely changing how I build


software. Google just released


anti-gravity. Most AI tools give you


code suggestions in a sidebar.


Anti-gravity actually controls your


browser, tests your app, records videos


of what it did, and gives you the


finished walkthrough so you can verify


everything works without lifting a


finger. I'm going to show you exactly


how this works, what makes it different,


and why developers are calling this a


gamecher.


Stick around because the browser


recording feature alone is worth your


time.


What actually is anti-gravity?


Anti-gravity launched on November 18th,


2025 alongside Google's Gemini 3 model.


It's an agent first IDE built by Google


DeepMind. Now, when I say IDE, I mean


integrated development environment.


Think of it like your coding workspace,


but this isn't your typical code editor.


It's built as a fork of VS Code. So, if


you've used VS Code, the interface feels


familiar, but under the hood, it's


completely different. Here's what makes


it special. Traditional AI coding tools


assist you. Anti-gravity agents work for


you. The agents can plan your project,


write the code across multiple files,


run terminal commands, launch your app,


open a browser, test the features, and


record everything they did. You describe


what you want built. The agent breaks it


down into tasks, creates an


implementation plan, then executes


everything while you watch or work on


something else. And here's the best part


right now. It's completely free during


the public preview. Free access to


Gemini 3 Pro, free browser automation,


free video recordings, no credit card


needed. Google is giving developers


generous rate limits to test this out.


Now, I'll talk about what this means for


your workflow in a minute, but first let


me break down the architecture because


understanding how this works will help


you use it better. The three surface


system anti-gravity works through three


main surfaces. The agent manager, the


editor, and the browser. The agent


manager is mission control. This is


where you orchestrate your AI agents.


You can have multiple agents working on


different projects simultaneously.


One agent building your front end,


another handling backend logic, a third


one writing documentation,


all running in parallel. But here's


where it gets interesting. The browser.


Anti-gravity comes with a Chrome


extension that lets agents control the


browser. Launch local host, click


buttons, fill forms, capture


screenshots, record everything. When I


first started using tools like this, I


was overwhelmed. That's when I found


this community called AI Profit


Boardroom. With over 2,000 members, all


focused on learning AI together and


sharing what actually works. It taught


me which workflows save time versus


which ones wasted. The community shares


real use cases and practical


implementations.


If you're serious about using AI to


improve your work and skills, check it


out. Link in description. how the agent


actually works. Let me walk you through


a real workflow so you can see this in


action. Say you want to build a water


tracker app. Simple Flutter app that


helps users track their daily water


intake. You open anti-gravity, start a


new workspace, type your request, build


a water tracker app in Flutter with


progress visualization and hydration


reminders. The agent immediately


generates a task list. Create Flutter


project structure. Design UI components.


Implement progress tracking logic. Add


notification system. Test on emulator.


You review the task list. Looks good.


Approve it. Next comes the


implementation plan. You can comment.


Change the blue theme to orange. Add a


settings toggle. The agent updates the


plan. Then execution starts. The agent


opens your terminal. Runs Flutter create


for the project. Installs dependencies.


creates the main file, builds out the UI


components, implements the progress


tracking logic, all while showing you


exactly what it's doing in real time.


After coding, it launches the app in the


emulator. Chrome opens with a blue agent


control border. You see a red dot on


screen. That's the agent's cursor. The


agent tests your app, adds water intake,


checks the progress bar, triggers


notifications. Everything's being


recorded. When testing finishes, the


agent generates a walkthrough artifact


with the full video recording,


screenshots, and a summary of what it


verified. You watch the video. Orange


theme applied. Notifications work.


Progress visualization is smooth. If


something looks off, you comment


directly. Fix the notification timing.


The agent updates the code. No context


switching. No manual testing. The proof


is right there. What models power? This


anti-gravity is powered primarily by


Google's Gemini 3 family. Gemini 3 Pro


for complex reasoning and coding. Gemini


3 Flash for faster iterations. Gemini 3


Deep Think for advanced problem solving.


For image generation, it integrates Nano


Banana, which is Gemini 2.5 image. If


you need logos or graphics in your app,


the agent can generate those, too.


Everything works together seamlessly.


Working with anti-gravity teaches you


new skills beyond just coding. You learn


to think architecturally.


Instead of writing every line yourself,


you're designing systems, describing


outcomes, orchestrating agents. You get


better at prompt engineering. How you


describe your requirements directly


impacts the quality of what the agent


builds. Clear, specific prompts yield


better results. You develop async


collaboration skills. providing feedback


on artifacts, commenting on


implementation plans, guiding the agent


without micromanaging. You improve your


testing mindset. Watching browser


recordings makes you think about edge


cases, user flows, what actually needs


validation and you gain efficiency.


Projects that used to take days now take


hours or less. This isn't about


replacing your skills. It's about


amplifying them. If you're looking to


dive deeper into AI tools and actually


implement them in your work, I recommend


AI Profit Boardroom. Over 2,000 people


learning how to use AI effectively.


Everyone shares real experiences.


What's working? What's not? Which tools


are worth your time? Which ones to skip?


No hype. Just solid information and


practical guidance from people doing the


work. It's helped me stay on top of


updates and figure out how to actually


apply them. Link in description if you


want to check it out. If you want the


full process, SOPs and 100 plus AI use


cases like this one. Join the AI success


labs in the comments and description.


You'll get all the video notes from


there, plus access to our community of


46,000 members who are crushing it with


AI.


What this means for development


anti-gravity represents a shift in how


we build software from typing code to


describing outcomes from manual testing


to autonomous verification. The video


recording feature changes everything.


Onboard team members by showing them


walkthrough recordings. Document bugs


with recorded reproductions. Send


clients walkthrough artifacts instead of


scheduling demo calls. The applications


extend beyond solo development. Teams


can run multiple agents on different


features. Parallel workflows. Everyone


working faster.


Final thoughts. Anti-gravity is free


right now during preview. Full access to


Gemini 3 Pro. Browser automation, video


walkthroughs, multiple AI models, no


cost. Is it perfect? No. It's a preview.


There are bugs, rate limits, learning


curves. But is it powerful? Absolutely.


If you build web apps, if you prototype


frequently, if you want to move faster,


anti-gravity is worth your time.


Download it. Build something small.


Watch the agent work. See the


recordings. The future of development is


about orchestrating intelligent agents


who can plan, build, test, and verify


while you focus on creative decisions


and strategy. Anti-gravity brings that


future to your desktop for free right


now. Go try it. build something


and let me know what you create. Thanks


for watching.
