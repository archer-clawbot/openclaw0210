today I'm going to be coaching one of


our SEO boardroom members Mike forg who


owns an agency wants to get more clients


wants to scale his acquisition and land


more clients using specifically LinkedIn


so we'll be talking about the best


techniques to use actionable strategies


are worth me how I scale my agency seven


figures using some of these acquisition


strategies if you want to get more


clients if you want to generate more


leits if you want to scale your agency


make sure you keep watching let's go hey


Mike how's it going hang in there bud


how you doing yeah good obviously at the


minute you're running the agency you


want to scale it I think the two


challenges that you have right now


number one client acquisition and number


two rank in locally from what we


discussed before could you give me a bit


more information yeah breaking out of


that white label mainly people white


label my services doing like SEO Google


ads stuff like that and I've almost


distanced myself from doing everything


individually myself so breaking out of


it and redoing it


for my own


agency uh I feel like my me myself


entering it I was muddying up the


process because I was like I'm so used


to working with my team and stuff like


that and yeah getting out of the white


label and offering local stuff and I


just launched the website for the my


agency a couple weeks ago and it's


already getting index for stuff but it's


now I'm looking at it as okay what do I


do next without getting in my own own


way when you know something too much


you're like what do I do next I'm


getting analysis paralysis that's where


I'm sitting at right now yeah that makes


sense all right and how are you


currently getting clients still white


label I've been posting a lot on


LinkedIn and then some of the stuff onto


Facebook which just is because I know I


have friends who will refer me and it is


more referral based like I'm definitely


still in that entry of like how am I


doing it myself and I just launched


Google ads


like three days ago four days ago at


this point now for just to test out to


see if there is a marker there and if


there's traction it was for a case study


that I had that was white label case


study for orthodontists dentists stuff


like that I like it's really good proof


I can't really show the person's name


but I could still show some data and


show that I know what I'm talking about


so that's what I'm starting on but no


nothing coming to that yet okay okay


yeah so right now you you're relying on


referrals you're posting on LinkedIn did


you say and then additionally you're


trying and testing payperclick


ads yeah where would you say the


majority of your clients come from


consistently it's always going to be


white labeled just because of that


history but right now linkedin's


actually doing pretty decent because


it's just kind of me posting about


things I like and I do talking about


marketing and advertising and then


a lot of people just starting businesses


are hitting me up and they're like I


need a website I'm like great I can do a


website and I can do your SEO and


they're like like awesome and then a lot


of friends that I didn't even think were


on LinkedIn ended up being on it and


were like Hey man can I refer this


person to you I was like yeah


totally guess it's a kind of a mix of


that LinkedIn and already known referral


that's cool and how many times you post


on LinkedIn per day now once per weekday


I do it every Monday through Friday um I


have a whole process for it that makes


it super easy so it's really not like to


time consuming and it's things that I'm


already learning so if I learn something


I want to elaborate on and talk about it


and I'll post it up and I'll be like


it's something I like anyway I'm gonna


talk about it so might as well post it


up yeah that makes sense it's quite an


interesting one there though because if


you already got a channel that converts


you're in a unique position I would say


because a lot of agencies you I'd say


converts to the most part because it


does have I have it but I don't have any


I don't have as much cold coming through


Linkedin it's it is more warmer people


who have have been familiar with me my


biggest one would be probably like I


would say who's I've had people come in


from actually Australia came in from uh


the other day was someone came in and


they asked me about SEO and I'm like


that's really cool because they like the


content I post and they like the way I


post so I'm like that's awesome but it's


not like it's an influx so not enough


data to be like it's so reliable but


it's


there yeah one of the things that we do


our agency is we have a spreadsheet with


everybody's task the day of the week and


then we have the inputs so for example


for you it could be like how many


LinkedIn postage you do and then we


track how many sales calls how many


sales did we get out of that and nice by


yeah it's good because you're basically


recipe that's kind of like a formula to


G agency right and I think if you


measured that


you'd become a lot clearer on okay


what's the cause and effect what do I


need to do today to get clients tomorrow


if that makes sense yeah definitely I


amum I feel like there's a lot of more


that I could try out I've actually


checked out your cold email


strategy which I haven't done cold email


in forever I might as well try it again


what's the worst that happens is I email


a bunch of people they don't respond to


me or they don't like me and then I just


go market somewhere else so I try to get


out of my own head that way but I know


that's a big numbers game and it's a


messaging game but I I have a very


minimalist attitude with this buyer


intent this why I like Google I like


search engines I


love Google ads and Google because it's


someone's going on and saying I need


help and then you're the result that


says I offer that they're going to those


people need help so that's really where


I like focusing my efforts but I know


that there're so much more diverse and


getting out of my own head running a


white label agency it's like you offered


to talk let's talk I'm like stoked on


this yeah that's awesome no really


you're active in the SEO boardroom like


you're posting often you come with the


Good Vibes like it's awesome having


people like you in that Community man


that's I'm absolutely loving the


boardroom at the minute so and it's good


to be to chat yeah thank I love the


moment I entered and I started seeing


the content in there I was like this is


what I needed something that kind of


broke my brain from it's almost like an


echo chamber


when you're looking at when I'm on


YouTube I look up exactly what I'm


looking up because of what it is but


when I'm in the boardroom someone just


checked this out like I wasn't thinking


that way I'm stoked on this it's great


yeah that's it I like the fact as well


there's experiments that I'll do and


then there'll be stuff that other people


post and I'm like I didn't even think


about that I'm going to test out right


now and then the next week I test out


maybe five or 10 times something like


that but just getting back to sorry


going it empowers you to test things


like when I see someone else test


something I'm like they're not afraid to


do it why don't I do it


like why don't I try it and then if I


fail I don't care I tried it and then I


learned from them and I go back it's


nice seeing other people try things that


are the same level as you or like appear


try something like all right cool it's


like I don't know if you've ever skated


or anything like that when I was like 14


15 yeah yeah and then it becomes like a


little bit attainable where you're like


oh if you can do it I can do it it's


like any sport almost or anything like


that you can do it it's like I'm Rel I I


have a relation to you maybe I can do it


that's what I love about it is if you're


sharing that information as a community


then you all grow as a result you all


help each other up and the one of the


biggest issues is right if you say post


this stuff on Twitter and you try and


help each other as a community there


it's just not a safe place to share that


stuff and there'll be a lot of


negativity that comes with it whereas if


you cultivate a community like this


where it's good vibes and people


interested in the same things and


testing things it's like a safe area as


well to share things in in a way where


you lift each other up you're not like


crabs in a bucket trying to pull each


other down yeah definitely not Twitter


was not a good environment for me I'm


like me too I can get not let say I can


get aggressive but like when someone


does something and then backtracks and


I'm like what we got to keep talking


about this and then you just let go I'm


like Twitter we can keep going on this


there's a whole it's either live or like


whatever their groups are or something


like that and I was like oh you're all


like connected somehow I'm this weirdo


that joined this group and I was like I


don't know how I feel about these clicks


anymore I'm out like


like I've I've spoken to without getting


off track we'll get back into the agency


stuff in a second but I've spoken to so


many seos this year who quit Twitter


because it's just like one of the worst


places to share stuff that's working I


notice on LinkedIn is quite positive but


Twitter it's an anonymous platform


that's the thing isn't it so it's anyone


can reply with anything they want to say


so it's an interesting one but getting


back to thing is when you post about on


LinkedIn get a lot of SEO followers I


want I want people who want to hire me


on


there this is another thing the one


thing I would say going back to LinkedIn


and I know you were talking about maybe


doing cold email and AdWords and that


sort of thing the one thing that's


worked really well for me is just


focusing on one platform and like


simplifying and just doing that for like


90 days until it's


systemized and then moving on to the


next one next one if I try and do


LinkedIn and cold email and AdWords at


the same time my brain's going to be


everywhere like I don't have enough


focus and energy to dedicate to doing


that r one thing so I would definitely


simplify if you can like if LinkedIn is


bringing clients in then just focus on


that and I've got some strategies and


some ideas that I think would help you


scale that and get more out of it what's


funny is like we just like hit a little


bit of it nail on ahead is where I ran a


white label agency and I can so easily


have someone go hey here's our new


client here's the budget great I take


that budget I tag in the teams now I'm


running my own agency and the first


thing I did was try to do it all myself


dude I have a whole team but it's


because I like The Challenge almost and


I like the maybe I'm a masus I like the


challenge but also I wanna I like to


feel and be part of it and I think maybe


I am getting in my own way maybe if I


focused on LinkedIn and I just gave the


designers and the and my ad Specialists


to work I've been like you guys do that


while I do this it would probably a


smarter move but yeah man I want to


learn whatever strategy you have that


offer like that that are good awesome


yeah a really good book on this by the


way is


essentialism and it basically teaches


you like how to usually like the biggest


gains I was always saw this is not by


adding more but by subtracting all the


stuff that's taking away your energy or


or biting away at you for example hiring


a team once you do that it frees up so


much of your mental energy that you


almost liberate


to get better results in every part of


the agency but when we come to LinkedIn


so number one first thing I would do is


set up an input Albert's tracker right


so each day of the week how many posts


you doing how many sales calls how many


leads out of that because you'll very


quickly gauge okay which post are


performing the best so you can try like


what did you write about and how many


Impressions did you get and then also


how many DMS you getting how many sales


calls you getting booked how many loes


you close it just become like a numbers


game where you track all the formulas


definitely going to do that definitely


I'll track definitely track I do exactly


the same thing with YouTube for example


like on YouTube I'll create a video and


I'll track the topic I'll track how many


sales SCS we got from it how many views


we got from it and that just gives me a


really good idea of okay if I talk about


this topic here's how many sales calls


we get if we talk about this topic okay


this one didn't get so many sales Calles


we're not going to talk about that one


again and so it just becomes a formula


where it takes a long time it might take


90 days to get that data but once you


get it you just get better and better


and you double down on the stuff that


works really well that's the first thing


the other thing I would say is and I


personally don't do this but I know it


works because I've seen loads of seos in


in the space talk about this and


recommend it is if you want to grow your


LinkedIn following because right now you


don't get much cold interaction right


it's mostly warm interaction that you


talked about if you want to grow your


LinkedIn following one of the best


things you can do is like find


influencers who are already taking off


already getting a decent amount of


Impressions and reach and comment on


their post as soon as they post it


people see that especially if it's a


useful comment and then click through to


your profile and then follow you it just


helps you get way more


reach yeah definitely I've noticed that


with a couple of the larger accounts


that I'm friends with and I know they


when when I get in touch with them


sooner when I comment or if they like


message me or they say anything to me


right away


I tend to get a little bit more of


attration on it yeah definitely it's


definitely a good strategy I call that


the drafting technique where you're like


these people already have what I need


hence white label they already have what


I need how do I draft off what they're


doing comes from my old the old days of


I don't know if you remember gck Halper


and social triggers and all stuff like


that that's RIT SEI and all that but he


did this whole thing about drafting I


actually wrote about it as like a just


for the heck I wanted to write about


what drafting was but it definitely


could see that working commenting on a


couple of them I usually ended up with a


lot of copywriters because copywriters


ask me about SEO stuff so yeah that's


pretty good man are you go yeah go for


it I was gonna say are you verified do


you have the blue tick on


Linkin or you have a premium profile or


anything like that premium yeah for me I


I think because I'm UK based I can't


actually verify it but if you can get


the Blue Tick I think some countries can


some countries can't if you can I think


that will help you get more reach as


well it's well worth doing for it I've


seen the same thing on other platforms


like for example Twitter as soon as I


got the Blue Tick The Impressions just


they doubled at least don't you pay for


the blue tick on Twitter like just pay


to have it and then if you change your


name or anything they take it away you


got to do it again and yeah I don't


change my name that often yeah I just


born with it and then I'm good to go I


remember the chaos of the Blue Tick for


a minute but you can on LinkedIn now


they've introduced a new feature where


you can just pay for the Blue Tick as


well I think all these platforms will


because of AI right because there's


going to be so many deep fakes so many


fake people it's like the only way to do


this is check the passport and tie that


to your social media profile yeah sense


yeah I didn't even think about like that


they're gonna be like hey Blue Tick this


is like a real person versus AI I always


thought it was just like hey like I'm


willing to put all go through a


verification process but yeah definitely


that versus AI it's definitely a good


way to look at it that's pretty awesome


yeah definitely so we've talked about


okay focusing simplifying eliminating a


lot of the channels and just focusing on


one that works really well tracking the


inputs outputs commenting other people's


posts getting the Blue Tick the other


thing that I think is like for you if


you want to


get more C interaction from people who


are not seos because I know exactly what


you're talking about like on LinkedIn


happens on every channel if you


personally I don't sell to seos I sell


to agencies who sell SEO but they don't


know that much about SEO they just want


us to handle it and so I would set up an


Outreach campaign on LinkedIn and you


can do this manually or you can automate


it there are two different ways to do it


but basically find out who's my specific


target market what do they look like put


all the filters in place on the search


and then set up an Outreach campaign to


all those people on the list so you


connect with them because once you've


connected with them they're going to see


your content they might DM you they're


going to get warmed up at least and it's


going to grow your reach because if they


like it it's going to grow to their


Network and and so on and so forth


that's how you grow really fast I would


say yeah I'm doing a couple with an


automation to help me get to like my


ideal client personas I built those out


which were really good learned a lot


about sales Navigator and how to like


really Niche down it blows my mind a lot


of these searches that are just like hey


we gave you exactly what you want but


for some reason We snuck in these random


things and you got to find out how to


get them out of there like if you look


up I only want I only want presidents


for some reason they're like you wanted


like the assistant to the chef in that


building and you're like where where


where' you get that from but yeah that


one's a good one I like to do for that I


usually like to view the profile wait a


little bit get another view and a like


on something view the profile then send


a a thing like hey I just checked out


your stuff a couple times I figured we'd


contact blah blah blah and just start


the conversation I definitely beat


around the bush a lot more than I think


I should though I'm not sure if I should


be as aggressive or if I should be stuff


but I'm like sales I'm used


to honestly a lot of my sales are just


like a lot of easier


conversations but being white label


somebody else always did my


sales so there's a few ways like what


I'm constantly doing on LinkedIn because


I I test he Outreach things as well


that's how I grew to like nearly 15,000


people on LinkedIn is just testing loads


of different messages running different


Outreach campaigns to different


audiences and it's like C email where


you testing okay what's the response on


this message does this work better


should It Go soft or should It Go Hard


do people respond well


to just a general message like I'd love


to connect or is it something where I


have to push like a free opin and I


think you just test and get the data


from that what I usually do though is I


you'll be really soft in the message


usually is hey would love to


connect and then they'll connect and see


the content and that's when they'll


finally DM me just test what works and


the other thing that I would say is


you've got the premium profile Linked In


do you already have the appointment


button sets


up yeah I don't use requests I have a


Services request or a request services I


don't let people book on my calendar I


just I hate when I'm like sitting there


and I'm like all right cool now I got


figure this out I want to talk to you


first because I do get a lot of people


like I've had people book on my calendar


that are like hey Mike yeah let's do


this and they know how to fill out the


forms and everything and then I get it


on and they're like you want to pay to


be at our like exhibit you want to pay


to be an exhibitor at our thing it's


like you just knew how to answer all of


my questions to get directly to me and


I'm like okay it's annoying you ate up


my calendar but definitely I could use


like high level like I have high level I


could use that to verify more I just


don't like VI with the open option I


want to be like hey what is it exactly


you want to talk about warm them up so


that they're already personally more


into me like I want them fill something


out and be like this is what I'm


interested in then I could talk to them


a little bit about it be like now we can


get more formal


or I don't know think booking on


someone's calendar is really like when I


book on someone else's calendar I'm like


great and then half the time they're


like yeah I can't make it I'm like but


your your calendar man maybe it got


burnt out on it from from Co and stuff


like that yeah I think it was way worse


during covid but I would test it out


personally but it's totally up to you


right feel free whatever we talk about


today feel free to discard what you


don't like and just use what you do


there's no no pressure to use any of


these techniques I can only say what


wors for me but for example the book and


appointment funnel what I typically find


is number one we have an automatic


filter so if people fill out the form in


the wrong way with the red flags they


can't book in a call and they'll get a


like lower ticket offer and then


additionally I do find like some people


they want that human connection the


message the call whatever but there's


some people they don't want any of that


like we have some clients who they only


want to buy through the portal they do


not want to speak to anyone they don't


want to mess around they just want to


place the order and forget about it so


it's quite interesting I think it's


worth testing see what you think yeah


the the other thing I was GNA say was


like with the Outreach I interviewed


Stephen caner from White press massive


link building agency and one of the


things that he gets his sales team to do


is send a voice note to connect with


people and so I think it's just a really


personal way of connecting with people


that is far better than telling them to


click on a calendar link yeah have you


tried voicemail drops at all using high


level yeah yeah I used to have a funnel


set up where when people opted into the


free book funnel it would send a Miss


call and then it would say hey Julian


Goldie here from Goldie agency looks


like I couldn't get through to you


listen if you want to book in a call or


if we can help you in anyway let me know


and then people be like ah I miss Julian


Goldie's call but got voicemail from him


I'll book in the call again now it works


really well people by that yeah I looked


at a couple strategies of scanning data


finding people who have bad rankings


them voicemail drops things like that


which has worked in the past for me I


haven't done it in a while but hey man


you don't even Rank and or you missing a


website these bad reviews I can fix this


problem if it's annoying you and you


can't selling people something that they


don't want so it's if you're like hey if


you don't want a website it's totally


cool I was just wondering if it was


something you're interested in and


they're like yeah maybe like it's like


aook they might just be like listen the


guy that the developer never finished it


or I'm annoyed and they have bad taste


in their mouth or maybe it's not


connected there's things like that that


I think kind of help because you at


least know there's a problem yeah I


think I've also taken a lot of these


courses that the people have been like


do it this way do it this way and I'm


like analysis paralysis I'm like if I


would just reach out to people just


making the action definitely helped yeah


L LinkedIn posting for 90 days


definitely got me noticed enough to get


some clients but it was because I was


like I'm gonna keep posting I enjoy it


see this what I like about tracking the


inputs and outputs because it's I know


that it's all action based and I know


for


example I'm taking action because I L I


can see the amount of posts being sent


each day and then if I want to


potentially double the output say okay


double the amount of clients or sales


cours we get from LinkedIn then I'm


going to double the imput and take even


more action or get my team to take even


more action I think that's one of the


best ways to do it one of the other


things I was going to say was like for


posts and this isn't for everyone but


this works for me is I'll create posts


with an optin that leads to booking in


the core and it'll be something like if


you want to learn the five best ways to


generate a topical map I've created


thisp plus a free AIS SEO tool just


comment yes below to get the tool when


they comment it will spread to their


Network then those people see it some of


those will comment yes as well and then


you can get loads of Engagement by doing


that and also when you send them the


link to opt in you've got their email


add in the funnel right they've already


entered the funnel that way so this


works really well too nice man are you


finding are you finding any particular


obviously YouTube is big for you are you


finding any social media in particular


like any Outlets that are the best for


you besides just like YouTube I know


that's like a a very big one for you any


ones that you like in


particular I've used LinkedIn for years


and years it is a good platform to get


clients if you can reach the right


people if you're just reaching link


Builders who are trying to sell you


links worst platform in the world you'll


just get spammed all day but if you


reach like on a corporate


level this works really well if you look


at people like FY Kone he's absolutely


nailing it on LinkedIn like getting a


lot of reach and he's one of the people


actually I would study and look at but


yeah YouTube is great all these


platforms work like what we do each day


is we see like where our sales course


coming from and we can see okay it's


someone coming from the website even


though that got the index which is weird


someone coming from email some are


coming from LinkedIn most of it comes


from YouTube we get a lot from Facebook


ads but this has come from seven years


of just building out one channel then


another Channel and gradually becoming


better at marketing along the way I


understand that there's like also this I


do obviously SE optimization I do a


little more holistic because like I have


the copy teams and stuff like that I do


the thing I actually link building is


the one that like I did when I was a


publicist and then understanding it is


when I started doing it was great


and then I outsourced it for so long or


like I would be like hey follow the


strategy whatever when I got back into


it I was like I hate doing this I forgot


how much I hated it but especially being


a publicist was like when I get the same


thing i' be like oh my God but


packaging your services like as you do


the backlinks and stuff are you finding


that a lot more clients want a solution


to a problem like backlinking which


you're doing agencies or if it's a


business I do local businesses a lot of


my businesses are


either service based that they're going


to be real estate agents and um


contractors home builders stuff like


that and then I also have the dentists


and Banks


CPAs what else landscapers I have all a


variety right now packaging things ver


like selling I see like TI is like SEO


and then the niche of like backlinks or


creating content or website management


those are all like variations but then


there's also like


SEO local marketing which could be like


I manage


your website your Google business


profile and your Google


ads what do


you I'm in this level right now I do the


full SEO but my want to sell this do you


find scaling is just better with doing


that one Niche thing 100% yeah because


everything comes easier like when you


sell one thing like that You' really


niched down and you know exactly how to


sell it and how to attract people's


attention with it whereas if for example


you start saying we do Facebook ads we


do PPC ads we do LinkedIn posts and by


the way we also do link building as well


then people don't really know you for


anything so the marketing becomes very


scattered and it's quite hard to really


talk to your audience in the right way


because typically what I find with marke


is consistency right if you look at


every single YouTube video that we do


it's like book in a sales go book in a


goal booking a SEO strategy session like


every single one and eventually it'll


people do it after watching five or 10


videos but if it was like at the end of


each video like if you want ads booking


a c if you want uh parasite SEO booking


a call if you want LinkedIn post booking


a call then it would just be a very


scattered message and very diluted so I


think it is far easier and then also


just on the processes side right every


single service you start selling


provides a whole new level of complexity


it's almost like a whole new business


cuz you made the client happy you've got


to hire the team you got to train the


team you got to Quality check their work


you have to make sure everything's


delivered on time and that's not just


for one thing now that's for one two


three four five things and so it becomes


very messy I would highly recommend if


you can just focusing on one service and


selling that I just had such a good


experience with kind of dominating a


local market with by


doing like Google ads local service ads


and Google business profile and organic


rankings I was like oh my God I just


took over this whole page this is


awesome can I sell this at a premium but


then I was getting a little worried that


I was like am I focusing on dominating


the whole page too much what if I can't


deliver that what do I really want to do


in this so that's something I want to


brainstorm and I was like I I never


really asked any you're actually the


first person I actually asked about I


know you're supposed to Niche down to


scale up because it's easier but I was


like I never thought about asking


somebody like this something that


someone


wants that a whole local local


domination service I suppose it is


niching down there already right like


you're not just a general SEO agency


you're focused on one thing which is


local SEO what works for a lot of people


is they'll just focus on selling local


SEO to one type of business so for


example like chiropractors or plumbers


and for example like one of my coach


which is Jos Nelson that I learned a lot


from he just owns like one of the


biggest Plumbing SEO agencies in the US


and replicates that formula in every


state this works really well yeah yeah


um I like doing it for I I found I did


that like as like programs and like


built a case study like I have that


orthodontist and dental one and I don't


want to just be known as like an


orthodontist and dental like SEO


specialist mainly because no like don't


have to follow your pass but am I do I


really want to do that I did the if I


followed my passion it would be you know


surfing and stuff like that and there is


no money in it and it's like all right


how do I actually get like this going


but I think about that I did do


contractors for a bit and it was gritty


let's put it that way very much what you


want guy and it's like all right man I


know you're busy you're sweating you're


doing this stuff you're metad at all


your teaching day and now you got to


talk to me about marketing so trying to


figure those out those little niches I


like selling the service and I like do


like selling local SEO a lot and doing


the Google ads was not a big switch to


me to sell it it's like always an upsell


it's do you want business tomorrow and


they're like yeah then you need to add


ads and they're like why I explained


that like SEO may take a little while


you want to you want business tomorrow


you need to spend money to to make that


money and it was an easier sell but cool


I'll think about it in a different way


see if I nich down to an industry or not


depends if you're optimizing for money


or if you're optimizing for fulfillment


right so for


example I can almost guarantee that if


you focused on orthodontist local SEO


for orst or just getting more customers


for offord dontis the marketing will be


so much easier you build up such a


reputation you get so many


referrals you build up a reach in that


industry and you've got less competition


as well that I can almost guarantee you


it would make you more money it would be


far easier to reach


clients and you would probably find a


marketing channel where you just rinse


and repeat that in every single state


like I'm going to work with one


orthodontist in


Lancaster and then you approach the top


five and and you say who wants to work


with me you get exclusivity I think it


would be for money optimization you


would make more money that way but if


you want to follow your


passion probably not going to make that


much money building back links with out


reach that was never my passion but it's


very scalable and it it made


money yeah I'm thinking which actually


pretty cool I think you when use


examples of things everyone's everyone


has their go-to examples I'm always like


pizza near me because everyone


understands Pizza near me it's it's an


easy one I just defaulted to


consistently using like orthodon


sententious as my examples it's not just


it's not necessarily branding me but


it's familiarizing me with that audience


to the point where it's that'll keep


being there there and if I saturate that


market or if I really enjoy that market


or like whatever and I'm doing it that's


awesome because it's in passing I'm not


like hey I'm just an orthodontist person


but it's my primary Market that I like


that's a pretty good way to do it so


that might be a good not pivot but


adjustment to that is being like hey I


don't own orthos SEO orthodon seo.com I


own nextstep connect.com and you'll see


case studies about orthodontist or


dental work that I do I actually built


had a case study like I said on the


White Label one one of my things was


like to outreach to people and go hey


like I really had this awesome success


with orthodontist like did up


orthodontist okay really great


experience working with this


orthodontist would you want to see a


case study on exactly how I rank them


number one nice and what orthodon is


gonna be like they say no and I be like


all right that's cool but if they say


yes cool I'll send it over to you what


email what email where do you want me to


send it to how do I hook you in but at


least that's something that's like


tangible free I don't have to be like


you want to hop on a call right now you


don't even know me it's now you could


see I can prove what I could do and in


that I actually put at the end of it is


what I would recommend for someone in


their situation so it's hey you already


got SEO and you're like whatever I don't


care but at at the end I could say like


why don't you go for local service ads


why don't you go for Google ads are you


doing anything else it actually had that


at the bottom hey maybe I just do your


ads and my ads person takes care of that


but I am lucky enough like where you


said it's harder to scale but I I've


built those teams for other agencies so


I have them I don't really I'm not too


stressed about scaling them because I


can I know how to on board for ads and


SEO at this point okay nice productize


them a little bit because I had to I


don't get to talk to the clients as much


so I had to productize what I offered so


when I managers or sales people talked


we got this and this and we know it's


attainable already yeah yeah that makes


sense so we've been through a lot of


actionable stuff today for example a lot


of tactics and you can watch back this


video if you want to take the action


points from that I didn't take notes I


was like I want listen it's all good


like the yeah the video will be posted


on YouTube so it'll be easy to to catch


up and see it and then I would


definitely look at like


simplifying and focusing more and then


potentially niching down but that's down


to you one of the easy ways to test that


is like you you just build a sister


brand you like offer dontis SEO for


offord dontis create a new website for


that try a bunch of marketing for that


and then see if it converts or not see


how many cents you get from it if it


works great if it doesn't you haven't


lost anything because you just created a


new website it takes about a day to set


up awesome man great yeah man talk I


talk to you on Discord pretty often I


guess at this point I GNA say I've


almost talked to you like for the last


week almost every day going back and


forth either in the in chat or in the


actual like every single different


Channel like so it's cool to to finally


hang out and do stuff yeah definitely is


not nothing better than one to one

better but and we'll be doing some
