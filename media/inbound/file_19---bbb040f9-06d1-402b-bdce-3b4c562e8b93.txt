So for those who are playing with
OpenClaw, I have mine going on a Mac
Mini.
But I have to you a very special guest
today because I saw something that really
blew my mind when I was browsing online.
And for those who don't know, I was
basically talking about Nick.
And so this is Nick Vasilescu and he has
a really interesting product that really
caught my eye.
And so while I was scrolling X, what I
found was really interesting is that he
has OpenClaw set up
so that he can have these various
sub-agents do tasks.
And what's crazy about this one is going
out on Upwork and literally looking for
these thousands of dollar tasks that AI
can actually do now
because you could just tell an OpenClaw
agent to go do it.
And my guy is literally spinning up like
eight different projects and sub-agents.
And so these are all different
sub-agents, each one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.
These are all different workers that are
working that OpenClaw spun up.
and it's literally going to Upwork and
applying for them, writing the code and
basically going to submit the bounty for
your behalf.
And it got me really thinking very deeply
that we're literally going to have a
future where these agents can then spin
off other computers and other types of
things to do work on its behalf.
And so obviously I have lots and lots of
questions. I have lots and lots of
different ideas for things that we can
do.
and I thought what better guest to have
than the person who's actually working on
this product and his name is Nick
Vasilescu based here in San Francisco,
has
a product named Orgo and you know this is
not a sponsored broadcast or anything. I
literally came across this on X less than
24 hours ago after doing my open claw
stuff and I'm extremely excited to talk
to
you Nick and have you on the show.
Welcome
to the show man.
Thank you, Ray. Thank you. Super excited.
And yeah, I think this is a cool time to
be alive, seeing all the acceleration.
It's like the newest ChatGPT moment,
maybe
bigger with the whole OpenClaw thing. And
yeah, I think there's so many ideas
around
what to build, what you can do. In fact,
it's a limit of our own imagination in
terms of what can be done. Because it
feels like if you can articulate it, then
you could probably create it. So happy to
be here.
Thank you.
Yeah, so I'm really curious because what
I was looking at basically was the fact
that, you know, we have this thing here
and I think you have an application here.
It's this computer used for agents.
So I never thought about this and your
application kind of made me really think
deeply about this.
It's like, wait, I used to tell a
computer what to do, but now I don't have
to.
I can have my open claw tell a computer
what to do.
So I'm super interested in learning more
about what you guys are doing here and
how
this is configured for OpenClaw.
And if you can kind of take me through a
demo or something and I could follow
along
your screen if that works for you as
well.
Yeah, yeah, I could share my screen. So
can you see my screen okay?
Let me pop over here. Perfect. Yeah.
Yeah, this is our landing page. It's
pretty nice. We just launched our new
landing page.
So Orgo, we create the computers for
agents. So like, you know, when we kind
of
first had this saying several months
back,
a lot of people maybe were confused about
like, what does that mean, like computers
for agents? Well, now with the open claw
moment, it's kind of clear, like why you
might want, you know, maybe a whole Mac
mini for your agents, right?
So we provide the computer infrastructure
to play nicely with these agents and we
give them the ability to control and
operate the computer.
So they can left-click, screenshot,
scroll up, scroll down, all of that, etc.
And just to be sure, you can hear me
okay? Because I don't know my response.
Yeah, you can hear me. Yeah, sorry, I had
my side muted, so yeah, we're good.
No worries. No, no, yeah.
Yeah, and yeah, so this is like, in that
video you saw me spin up like all these,
you know, I have seven sub-agents. This
one here, Stard, is the main agent, and
it
had these sub-agents spawn, look at
Upwork, look for tasks that they could
automate, and no two of the same tasks.
Like, these are different projects, so
like they're, you know, they're not
working all on the same thing, which is
kind of cool, because this idea of like
parallelization of agents and sub-agents
working on their own things with their
own
context, but also not bumping into the
same thing.
into the other ones and like, I guess,
creating any redundancy, right? And if I
like click into like this
project here, we're in the workspace or
the project Claude Army that I made. And
if you like click in
here, you can see all the different
projects that those sub-agents did. And
we
actually pulled them
into the main agent's computer
environment. And like, I actually even
had
like earlier, I was asking,
you know, Claude to tell me which project
was the most impressive. And it was like,
oh,
Agent No. 7 was the best because it did
the most thorough job of actually
fulfilling for the proposal and creating
the demo data and everything.
And you can see here, it just made
everything. It made all the Python
scripts. Everything is here such that you
could apply to maybe this proposal.
And everything is like, I mean, for the
most part, as far as you can get with
just
the proposal itself from Upwork, right?
That's impressive.
Yeah, it's insane. What's actually really
interesting is the way I was thinking of
this in the past was that, oh, I would
have to install a Claude bot into seven
or
eight Claude bots, one for every
computer.
That's actually not the case. You can
have
one Claude bot spawn its own sub-agents,
each with their own computer.
Oh.
So like if, yeah.
Oh.
Okay, so let me see if I can kind of
digest this a little bit because there's
a
lot that's
kind of going on here for those who are
just kind of getting started with this.
I think people who are maybe just getting
started with ClaudeBot maybe kind of, it
may seem a
little bit obscure, but in essence what
we're doing, folks, is that we're taking
the concept
of ClaudeBot, and you may currently chat
with it in Telegram.
If you're telling their Claude bot to
generate some code or write some pieces
of
software, whatever models you have
configured, it's going to just write some
software in its own little environment
that it's basically currently living in.
And so what Nick's company has is this
thing called Orgo.ai, and they have this
thing called Computer Use Agents.
And that's basically like a different
environment that's set up somewhere else.
And the agent or your Claude bot that's
available right now can technically use
that as a tool.
and so it can say hey go talk to that
computer over there and then you're now
telling the computer what to do and so
historically if you wanted to set up like
all these coding environments in these
different places this is something that I
was really deeply trying to look into and
figure out okay I have to have set up
tokens for all these different types of
things you know all the API keys in all
these different places with all these
different computers everywhere and you're
saying that I don't necessarily have to
go
through all that crazy confusion.
configuration. And this is kind of what
I'm trying to learn here today. And
hopefully you as a person
who's watching this can learn something
new. So yeah, Nick, please share a little
bit more about
this type of workflow because I'm really
curious now. You know, like literally one
agent is spunning
off like eight of them and it's acting,
you know, it's like he hired another
agent
to go do work for
him too. My agents are hired another
agent. So yeah, this is kind of like
meta,
but I want to kind of
break that down for anyone who's kind of
confused here and figure out, you know,
kind of what that's
looking like. So, and this is the Orgo
thing. So, yeah, I'll go back to your
screen share so that you
can share a little bit more here. Okay,
yeah, absolutely. So, I guess, like, so
to
start, like,
our company, we provide an SDK and all
the APIs to be able to, you know, spin up
a computer,
give all the tools and resources to your
agent that it would need to operate that
computer.
so you can see here in our docs, this is
just docs.org.ai, like you can create a
workspace, create a computer, control the
computer, take a screenshot, click at
these coordinates, type text, run these
commands, do all these things that your
agent can now, you know, have native
access to, you know, via our API
reference
here.
and so when I made that video of like
okay here's let's let's spin up
sub-agents
you know with their own computers and
have
the sub-agents operate their computers
that was something that I put together in
like an hour and I'm like 100% sure
someone could probably even do a better
job than me and I guess I could just show
you like how to create this skill
essentially to enable your open claw or
your agent to be able to spawn these
sub-agents into Orgo and be able to you
know spin up these
computers and have each sub-agent go off
and accomplish a task and do its, you
know, you can
imagine maybe you have seven sub-agents,
but each one of them is specialized to be
really good at one
thing. Like your ideas can just keep
going in terms of like what you can build
with Orgo and computer use
agents in general. That's fantastic. Wow.
Yeah, it's really like, yeah, it's really
like the mind,
I mean, the imagination is the limit.
Like, it's, you can do anything that you
can think of. So, like, in here, this is
a
project that, you know, go ahead, Ray.
Yep.
Oh, I was thinking, can each agent do the
work on a specific API key when spawned?
BuildWithAntonio was asking this question
here.
Can each agent do the work off of a
separate API key? You could just share
the
single API key here. You just copy it,
click this button, and then that's all
you
need to be able to spin up, you know,
several computers within the same
workspace. So like one of them can have a
Gemini computer and
another one can have like a Anthropik key
for one of your computers. Is that kind
of
maybe that he was
thinking about that or? Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You could do it that way. Yeah. We're
like
model agnostic. So
like with computer use agents, like you
might see like the benchmarks from
Anthropik or OpenAI or
and Gemini and like they have computer
use benchmarks on their models. So like
you might think that like,
okay, that's a formal computer use model
and it is like they've trained it to be
good at computer use
for those benchmarks. But you can use
something like Kimi 2.5, which is not by
any means considered
to be a computer use model, but you can
give it computer use capabilities with
the
Orgo, you know,
SDK and EPIs just because it can visually
interpret something and then it could
just, you know,
and programmatically call the function to
click at this coordinate and do this and
do that.
So you can really just use any model.
Yeah, that's the nice thing.
Oh, that's cool.
That's awesome.
Yeah.
So this here is like a project that Ray
and I made.
I have Ray Fernando here.
I invited him into this project.
And here we have like three computers.
And I can like click into this computer.
Obviously, I could like actually operate
the computer myself.
And so I guess maybe just even for a
first demo, like understanding this whole
concept of an agent being able to
actually
control your computer, I think this might
just be interesting.
So I can just show you, let's just maybe
say search up Ray Fernando on Google and
research information about him.
So, if I say this, you can see that,
like, maybe how a lot of people think of
computer use is just via, you know,
clicking UI elements of the, like, GUI,
of
the, you know, graphical user interface,
and that's definitely true.
My evolution in terms of how I think of
computer use, definitely my thoughts
around it have evolved.
It is that the ability to interact with
the UI and click on buttons and such but
also it the ability to use native like
cloud code agent SDK capabilities of
opening up the files in the computer and
the folders etc and be able to operate
the
computer that way This is taking just a
second It work It just I think our APIs
have been getting hammered with a lot of
new adoption which is great
Yeah.
And this should work here soon.
That's cool.
Yeah, for those who are wondering, you
can select the model of that dropdown
there,
and you can also select other attributes
for controlling this computer for those
who are wondering and what's kind of
happening here.
and so I imagine that if you have this
machine, this computer and it's spun up,
if it's done with a task, does it just go
away or like, you know, can I reuse it
again later on or what's the thinking
here
too?
Yeah, so like you can spin up and spin
down the computer so like create them and
then delete them.
if you want it to be like more of, I
guess, like, you know, like single
purpose.
You want to use it for one task maybe and
not have your, like, keys left behind,
for
instance, on that computer.
But you could also just leave the
computers up and persistent, and you can,
like, come back to them a week later,
and they'll be exactly how you left them.
And so, yeah.
Oh, here you go.
It's working.
So you can actually see this is it
showing you, it already has Firefox open,
I already opened it for it.
It screenshots it, it sees the problem,
it closes out of the dialog box, okay,
cool.
And now it's going to actually use Google
and search Ray up here.
So actually, the really cool part about
this is a lot of browser use types of
agents,
they'll spin up headless browsers which
don't actually have the same I guess
functionality of what you and I would use
which is like just opening up Firefox and
clicking around and typing because
there's
a lot of like bot protection against like
headless browsers and things like that.
So this can actually you know do anything
that you and I can do.
Wait that's our live stream right now.
Did you see where it says swarm earlier?
That's crazy, we're already ranking on
Google
Our live stream is not even, what, how
many minutes old?
14 minutes old and we're already showing
up on, that's insane
It's amazing
People want the computer use forms
Dude, that's insane
That's crazy ranking
Literally from going live within 14
minutes, we're on Google
This is not you scrolling, by the way,
that's the agency
This is not me scrolling. Yeah, yeah.
Wow, this is really cool. So what this
reminds me of, there is a feature in
ChatGPT. If you paid for a pro account,
you can have like 100 uses of this type
of
thing where you would actually send it
across.
But what I like about this is because I
exported all of my ChatGPT chats and also
all my Anthropic chats out.
and while I didn't use this feature a lot
this was like part of a pro plan feature
and now you can just bring that
into your own agents too just by having
it hook up to Orgo so I guess with Orgo
you know you can take
your claw bot and give this type of
capability to it but web browsing is only
one feature because this
is basically a computer that you've spun
out in the cloud but it can also have
access to the command line
It keeps all this stuff isolated onto
that machine.
It can write code.
You can probably spin up the terminal, so
I could probably set up a headless Claude
Code, Codex, Droid, and everything all in
one spot.
I could probably install Cursor if I
wanted to or something.
And the possibilities kind of go crazy,
right?
Huh.
Exactly.
Oh, wow.
Yeah, you could actually install
applications into the computer itself.
So this is something that we're working
to push here soon, which is essentially
templates where you can have
pre-configured computer environments that
might have Slack installed or some
application that might help an agent do a
particular task well.
And so you can imagine there's a template
on Orgo for, you know, oh, here you go,
by
the way, it's done its research on you
and
it gives the research summary here.
That's so crazy.
Yeah.
So you can imagine like you could have a
template made where it's like a video
editor template where it spins up, you
know, Premiere Pro or something and it's
just very good at video editing and
that's
the computer use agent. It's very good at
computer at video editing and that's like
its own templates. Yeah. It's pretty
cool.
Yeah. Bro, you're blowing my mind right
now. Okay.
Yeah, you can like, it's just, the
possibilities are endless. And so I guess
like, first and foremost, I can show
essentially, this is just the playground.
Like, this is actually not necessarily
our
product, but we are surprised to see how
many people use the playground. But you
can actually install ClawDot into, or
OpenClaw, into this computer. And it's
just very simple. I'll just show how to
do
it real quick.
you just take this command here from
their website, openclaw.ai, and you can
literally just paste it here and hit
enter.
This is going to get meta.
Yeah.
So your Clawbot can then spawn off
another Clawbot inside of it if it wanted
to, and then start bossing that guy
around.
Exactly, exactly.
So like here, what's funny is, I'm sure
when you installed ClaudeBot, you know, I
would like to think that I'm pretty savvy
when it comes to, you know, installing
these, you know, terminal interfaces and
CLIs.
And even for me, I was like, man, this is
kind of a pain to set up. So what's kind
of nice here in Orgo is you can actually
just have the agent here on the
playground
help set up ClaudeBot for you.
So, once it's fully installed here, like,
I just ran that one command, that's all I
did, then I could ask the playground
here,
like, hey, like, configure my API key so
I
can use Claude, or like, you know, Opus
4.6, or you could ask it, hey, like,
let's
set up the gateway, or let's set up this
channel with Telegram, and you just, with
natural language, ask the agent here to
do
it for you, and then it sets up Claude
bot
for you. It's kind of meta, like you
said.
So for those who are wondering, basically
this is a computer that you get, a
computer use agent that is spun up on the
platform.
And instead of having like, I mean,
there's a lot of different ways that you
can use it.
You can use it as a standalone agent
environment so that you can actually run
Clawbot just by itself.
So if you're not wanting to get a Mac
Mini, you can just use something like
this.
And the computer is there and it's doing
its thing.
obviously you're going to pay for the
hours that the computer is up so that's
kind of like that your cost wise if
you're
thinking about this thing which is
different than having like a dedicated
environment if you're paying for you know
somewhere online or something like that
from like Amazon EC2 or whatever that
like
my EC2 instance costs 30 bucks a month
and
I only get one of those I can't get like
50 of them you know because I just have
one of those types of things and so
that's
just kind of something to kind of keep in
mind right.
where here the way that you can also
think about it is that it sounds like all
the tooling for this is set up so that
other agents can start talking to this
environment.
And so spinning up an environment like
this that has everything self-contained
and also the ability for it to actually
use a browser and control it is a really
interesting concept here
because it adds capabilities to your
Claude bot or your OpenClaw bot thing so
that you can browse the web or do other
things.
and it's not like a headless browser per
se but it's more of an actual real
browser
that it actually is sending computer use
commands so it can control and do
research
and parse and those types of things.
Literally just from plain text, English.
Wow.
Exactly. Yeah, and I don't know about you
Ray, do you, when you use your Clawbot
with the Mac, do you usually like have a
monitor that's up and running so you can
like watch it do stuff or do you kind of
just let it like monitor off?
What's your setup like?
The setup I have is I just do a remote
control and see the screen.
That's what I'm doing for the setup right
now.
Eventually, I'm just going to do it over
Telegram.
I'll just be talking through Telegram.
If I need to do something, I'll probably
do this stuff.
I had one set up with EC2, and I was
using Cursor.
I would just SSH and be a cursor, and
then I would use the Cursor Agents to do
all the commands.
so that it would, you know, like, you
know, set up things or inspect files and
all that stuff.
Nice.
Wow.
But the thing is, when you have a thing
like EC2, you couldn't, like, really
install a browser as easily to do, you
know, web browsing tasks
and actually really inspect what's going
on on that machine, you know.
Unless somebody knows a way.
For me, I really couldn't find an easy
way to do that.
Yeah.
Exactly.
Like, I don't know.
It kind of feels like maybe I think
people when they when they look, this is
kind of cool. It's like opening its
terminal. It's going to get OpenClaw set
up for us. Yeah. And when people like
this
is kind of how you would want OpenClaw to
work when you have your Mac. I don't know
about you or maybe other people, but if I
had OpenClaw installed onto my Mac, like
you would kind of think like, oh, it's
going to actually click around it and do
things. But no, it's actually it's not.
It's going to run everything.
like headless and it's not going to
actually like, you know, operate like
this
essentially.
And so giving your agent your OpenClaw
access to the ability to click around and
have all the same tools that you and I
have access to on a computer, it kind of
just opens up all the possibilities.
And it's also from an observability
standpoint, like I just want to see what
my agents are doing.
And so we've thought about this a lot in
terms of just, yeah, like observability.
Yeah, so you're actually seeing the
commands that they're running, you're
seeing what they can do in front of you,
literally, and you don't have to worry
about some rogue terminal back session.
Yeah, I think that's a really interesting
concept. And so when it's putting the key
in, is it like, where is it getting the
key from?
Well, for the, like this step right here
for the model auth provider?
Yeah.
Yeah, so now it's going to ask me like,
okay, like we have a few options here.
And so let's just, here, if you don't
mind, I'm going to copy and paste my key.
Let me go back here.
Back here, yeah.
Okay.
Yeah, so right now it's just showing me.
Yeah.
Okay, perfect.
I'm going to just create a quick key,
test key, default, okay.
copy that and then let's see.
And let me answer some questions from the
folks here.
So are APIs the newer concept or are they
just being, just exploded because of Vibe
Coding and now agents?
Yeah, they basically have always been
there, but I feel like Vibe Coding and
agents have brought pretty much
everything
out to the forefront from like
environment
variables, API keys,
these things that developers would have
to spend lots of time reading. I remember
reading lots of
documentation and looking at specs and
then sometimes the documentation isn't
complete so then
you'd have to go look at the source code
and you know there's a lot of different
types of things
and AI agents are really kind of speeding
a lot of this stuff together and smashing
it so definitely
appreciate that. Hey good morning Raza.
The podcast as well we did a really good
recording this morning
of the Rate Limited podcast for those who
are kind of tuned in yesterday.
So I did our recording this morning.
I got a little bit of sleep, but all is
good right now.
Let's see.
Did I purchase the base model Mac Mini?
Yeah.
So for my situation, for those who are
wondering, if you haven't watched the
full
video yet, because
I have a little stream yesterday where I
was getting it set up, I have the base
model Mac
Mini.
So this is basically 16 gig of RAM, 256
gigabytes for the hard drive.
and this is literally just going to be my
orchestrator So this agent this guy is
going to be the one that really talks to
everyone else And so this is running the
Opus 4 model And this is going to talk to
my AWS stuff It going to talk to my home
network to run local inference
It's also going to talk to other
machines.
So the reason why I brought up Orgo and
kind of why I wanted to reach out to Nick
was, for those who are wondering,
it's like I started to do this cool demo.
I was scrolling on X, as one does.
and I saw this cool demo and I thought
man this is really really crazy. So let
me
go ahead and see if I
can pop back to my screen real quick
here. Okay cool. So on X when I was
scrolling I was like this guy
literally just went to Upwork and told
his OpenClaw to just go and apply to all
these jobs and because
OpenClaw is really good at writing code
right like you know that's each of those
different windows were
or like one specific upwork task that he
was doing. So that one open claw agent
will basically,
you know, spawn these off as different
tasks and let them do their thing and
they
come back to the
open claw. And so there's a couple of
interesting things that I took away from
that that I thought
was really interesting, which is kind of
why I wanted to have Nick on the show is
because,
okay, my open claw doesn't have to eat up
all of my opus token limits because I
only
have so many of
and I really want the brains of my agent
to be really, really smart. So that's
like
my Mac Mini,
my orchestrator thing. And so in order
for it to do those types of tasks, you
know, I can hand them off
into different environments to get that
stuff done. And so that's why I'm really
interested in this,
because now each of these workers can
work with their own, you know, API keys
or, you know, I can
use GPT-5.3 or I can use a different
model that is really good at computer use
control. It doesn't have
to be the most expensive model,
especially like a Sonnet model or
something. I really don't know what
all the benchmarks are, but we can ask
Nick about that. And that's kind of
really
what got me
intrigued. It's like, what other types of
work can I spin off where my main agent
can just not be kind
of handling that and that could just be
done on some other type of
infrastructure?
And there's a couple
of things, and this is kind of where I'm
thinking about this, and maybe Nick can
kind of help clear
this up. But I want to minimize my blast
radiuses. So as these agents go do work
or
as they assign tasks,
if something happens, like a prompt
injection attack or something like that,
they're pretty much
contained or isolated to those
environments. So that way I don't expose
anything more up the chain.
And so that's kind of my thinking here.
But yeah, Nick, would love to hear some
more about what you're
thinking. Am I right? Am I just kind of
making stuff up? Or, you know, this is a
totally new space to me,
you know, and I'm learning more as I go.
Yeah, I mean, as far as, yeah, I guess
security, right? Like
everyone is wondering how do we make sure
that we don't get prompt injected like
you
said.
Did you see that whole thing on Moltbook
with the skills?
Like one of the top skills was a security
thing that they prompt injected and they
stole information.
Did you see that?
Yeah, that was crazy.
Yeah.
I was telling people yesterday that I
like to just inspect the skills and if
there's something interesting,
saying I could just build my own skill
file without installing skill because the
agents are capable of building their
skills too, right?
Yeah. Can you imagine if instead of the
main agent, the main OpenClaw, when it
went to that skill and it got prompt
injected and it had all of its keys that
it gave out because it's the main agent,
If instead it just spawned its own
sub-agent with its own isolated context,
which it can do, OpenCloud can do this,
right?
Which didn't have access to all the key
information, it's its own sub-agent, and
it had its own computer environment that
was spun up and spun down.
Like, that problem would just not exist.
So you could imagine if, like, for every
maybe specialized task, you can spit up a
sub-agent for it.
or for maybe you could have a subagent
that is specialized for security purposes
of like maybe it's very good at avoiding
prompt injection or something like this.
I think you could just get really
creative and OpenClaw right now supports
up to eight subagents, I believe.
I think there's even a way that you can
change it.
I asked OpenClaw to update its own
subagent limit and change it.
I only tested it with the 8th, but I
think maybe I can get it to do like 20
sub-agents, but it's just how much do you
want to spend on tokens, you know?
That's crazy.
Yeah, so let's go back to your screen
here so we can see what's going on.
Yeah, so now I think, okay, so it set it
all up.
Let's see, it's like, would you like, so
this is, like once again, I'm asking the
Playground agent to set up OpenClaw for
me.
So now it's like, okay, would you like to
open the dashboard in Firefox?
Let's just say like, actually, I think
what I can do is I can open a terminal
here.
And let me just see if I can do OpenClaw
T-U-I, I think that's the command.
And then that way I can just talk with
it.
Best.
Oh, gateway not connected. So I can just
ask it to set up the gateway. Set up the
gateway for OpenClaw and I just give it
that and let it just do that. But yeah, I
guess this is kind of like, this is how I
set up OpenClaw. Did you do it manually
when you did it, Ray?
Yeah, I did it through the command line.
But that was on the Mac Mini. And then
the
first time I did it was, I think, about a
month ago. And I did it, like, my friend
AJ was, or aka tech friend, he, we were
walking in San Francisco. And, of course,
like, when you, I got to pull out the
laptop, and we got to sit down at a park
bench. So we did it live from the park
bench, which was pretty cool. And we
provisioned the EC2 and just did it all
through, like, the terminal.
So yeah, the TUI setup. Yeah. Nice. Yeah,
and like, I do think the EC2 setup is
maybe like, it's probably like this, I
guess they have it now like simplest like
out of the box, it just works, is that
right? Yeah. Yeah, well also, like now
the
commands line, just that one command line
installs everything on the Mac now, so if
you don't have Homebrew install, it'll
install it for you. If you don't have
Git,
it'll set up literally everything that
you
need.
which I thought was really cool because I
saw some videos where people were saying
make sure you install Node, make sure you
install Homebrew and it's like you don't
need that anymore.
It's just that one liner will do
everything so that's pretty cool.
Nice. Oh, I think my key is cooked. It's
okay, there's a limit on it. You guys
have
fun.
Oh, right, right, right.
It's like, it's $20, it's fine. But yeah,
this is just going to do that.
And then while this sets this up, I'll be
able to see here in the actual virtual
machine screen when it's like opens up
the
chat interface. Let's see. Yeah. So once
that happens, it'll be all set up there.
But maybe in the meantime, I could also
just talk about like, you know, why might
you want to have like sub agents and like
how to think of them, right?
So with skills, skills are really
interesting because they're kind of just
like, obviously, they're specialized
instructions to be able to have kind of
like vertical use case agents.
And I think this is where the opportunity
is.
So I'll share this actually really
interesting paper from Andreessen
Horowitz
on the rise of computer use and agentic
coworkers.
So they talk about like the TLDR of this
paper is that vertical use case computer
use agents are where the opportunity lies
because the general computer use agents
will just not have enough specialized
knowledge and skill sets to be able to
accomplish like meaningful, you know,
business related outcome tasks, right?
So to actually solve a problem within an
organization, there's specific nuance in
how things need to be done, standard
operating procedures, for instance.
And that's where the verticalization, the
specialization of a computer use agent is
important so that it can do this task
super well.
So in the context of sub-agents, it's
like maybe each sub-agent, the way to
think of it is that each sub-agent is
just
very good at this one thing.
You might have one sub-agent that's
really good at, I don't know, like
looking
up product information, getting all the
pricing and metadata on that product, and
then aggregating that into like a report.
And then you have another sub-agent
that's really good at this other thing.
But this paper I just wanted to share
because as far as I know a lot of your
audience is entrepreneurs, and as far as
like an opportunity, you can see it here.
We believe properly verticalizing
computer use and assisting companies and
adopting it will be a major area of
exploration for startups.
So that's like the one liner that kind of
sums it up in terms of the opportunity
around like specializing agents to do
tasks very well.
And this is where I bring it back to why
I think like sub agents being spawned
that
are like specialized at certain tasks
that
you develop over time.
I think that's like super powerful.
So let's kind of unpack that.
Yeah, yeah. So like that you're saying
what you have currently is a platform.
And
as an engineer, I can define a workflow,
for example, Upwork, right? So let's just
say you had an Upwork computer use thing.
So you can almost spin up a whole service
for other ClawBot users specifically to
find these like low hanging fruit tasks.
And you can also have like maybe a coding
environment spun up.
so like you can maybe have everything
that you need as far as like all the
ingredients and so the
parallel I think of here it's like having
a kitchen right so if you have a kitchen
with all the
ingredients you need and you're the
person who does fried chicken the best
you're gonna have like
you're gonna develop recipes in essence
for different you know like flavors of
chicken and
whatever you serve and so when people
come to you as a factory you can kind of
produce this output
but economic value consistently.
And so that's a really cool paradigm for
me to think about these agents that are
computer use.
And so the computer use that you're
providing as an environment is like the
kitchen that people can have a blank
slate
with
and then configure it for some type of
economic value that you want to provide.
So that literally can be a million-dollar
business overnight.
I feel like if you've got to go, oh,
okay, I think I'm picking up what you're
putting down.
Yeah, no, you 100% nailed it.
Like, I think the Claude Bot moment is,
like, super cool because here's this
general purpose agent that's very good.
It's very good at a lot of things, but
it's not, like, specifically good at,
like, doing, like, it wouldn't know how
to
do your weird workflow that you just, you
know, you have this meticulous process
that you just have to do these, click
that
button, click that button.
Like, it wouldn't know that, but it's
good at, like, okay, it could figure out,
you know, most general things, right?
So there's that, there's that bucket.
But then there's all these other, you
know, vertical use cases that you need
help with that over time you can like,
you
know, build as their own sub-agents with
their own skill sets.
And like, I think that that is in terms
of, okay, like business opportunity.
Well, first and foremost, okay, let's
talk about that general agent.
Can you help businesses implement a
general purpose agent like OpenClaw?
You know, you invite them into a
workspace in order, you have the computer
set up for them, it just works for them
out of the box.
and you manage, you have an observability
layer, an orgo of like seeing their
computer, being able to go in, debug
stuff
and do it that way.
And so that like the general agents And
then can you create sub that are
specialized for like computer use
specific
tasks along the inside that workspace to
you know accomplish different tasks
within
the business so that like its own thing
too It like if you just did that even if
you only did specialized vertical agents
alone even that I think is just you know
even Andrews and Horowitz in that
paper, that's a huge opportunity. And so
I think like the way that like B2B
verticalized SaaS was like,
you know, the talk of the town for so
long. I think this is going to be like,
you know,
and Verticalized Agents will be
infinitely bigger actually in terms of
the
opportunity in that.
So this is a really good question.
So is it like a main agent controlling
multiple sub-agents?
And yeah, if you want to show the demo
real quick that we're talking about for
the Upwork thing,
I think that could be really cool to kind
of, there's some newer folks who are kind
of joining in
and kind of figuring out, you know, what
is this platform and how can they use it,
how can they leverage it?
and so in essence we have a thing called
computer use and you have this platform
that basically allows the agents whether
it's an open claw thing or whatever to
then start to use as a container to do
whatever you want to do.
Yeah, let me go ahead and switch over to
your screen here.
So would you say that the Orgo is for
anyone who wants to leverage a hosted
open
claw instance?
I actually think like Orgo is actually
better suited to support like sub-agents
because like I think you know I mean yes
you can you can put the general agent I
end up doing that as well here in terms
of
like putting the main agent inside of
Orgo
you can do that but it's actually it's
even better suited to set up like
sub-agents that are just like they're not
always it's not the main thing that
you're
interacting with.
but you want the main thing to interact
with the sub-agents and you do that in
Orgo.
Like I can show, as you saw on my
Twitter, I'll mute the volume, I can't
listen in my own voice.
But you can see here like, you know, this
was kind of the demo I did yesterday of
like, here's seven sub-agents with their
own context that were spawned from that
first starred agent right there.
that agent spawned these seven sub-agents
to each go apply to proposals on Upwork
with a completed project before even
applying.
So they all created, and I'll show that
here, they all created their own files
and
projects.
You can see this one here, Worker No. 5,
created its own code, everything all done
for that project that it was interested
in
applying for.
And Worker No. 7 did the same. It has its
own project with its own code that it
wanted to...
Oh, where is it? Let's find it. It's in
there somewhere.
But you can see over here in the main
one, here's all of the different projects
from all the different agents that they
all did.
and it pulled it into the main one.
Yeah.
Whoa.
Pretty cool.
Yeah, I like how you call it Claude,
C-L-A-W-D, King.
Yeah, this is the main.
So you can see I did it here, right?
So I have like the main agent here and
these are like all the different
sub-agent
virtual machines.
And the way I did that, guys, is all I
did was you just go to docs.orgo.ai
and you can literally grab the
llmsfull.txt and you can copy this and
then you can paste it into your CloudBot.
So you can say, hey, I want to be able to
make a skill to use Orgo API to spin up
VMs for subagents.
and then just paste all of that.
Click enter.
Oh wait, did I click out of, oh I need
to, let me retry that.
OpenSlaw, T-U-I.
I clicked out of the chat box, let me
just do that one more time.
Okay.
Make a skill to connect to Orgo API to
spin up VMs.
for sub-agents. Boom. Whoa. And then you
let your Claudebot create the skill to be
able to do that.
So we'll let it cook. We'll see how it
goes. Wow. And you're using the Moonshot
Kimi 2.5 for your
Open Claw there. So tell me more about
that. Like what's been your experience
there?
Yeah, I think it's like so much cheaper.
It's actually quite good. Obviously,
like,
you know even for this kind of skill
creation task it would be better to use
Opus I'd have more confidence in using
Opus for this type of task but it's going
to do fine if there's if there's a
problem
it'll it'll it'll debug it maybe instead
of a one shot it's a two to three shot
thing that's fine it's just such a
cheaper
model that it's so great for I made a
video on Twitter of like how to connect
your open claw to iMessage and you know I
want to be able to text my open claw and
be able to treat it like just
like a friend. I don't want to spam text
it, you know? So I don't want to just
burn
through tokens
with Opus 4.6 to do that. I see. Wow. I
like this for Jason says, I added the 11
Labs key for daily
brief voices. So he gets a daily brief
and it says Coco works well, Coco Roll,
like the local model
works well, but it does sound like a
robot. Yeah. The new 11 Labs voice that
just came out, have you
heard their recent voice agent, like
yesterday?
She's saying the way it sighs and the way
it, yeah, it's like emotionally, it's
like, have
you seen the movie Her?
Samantha?
Yes.
The movie Her?
Oh.
Oh, man, this is going to get scary, bro.
Like, people are going to fall in love
with their bot.
Oh, wait, I actually have, you're going
to love this.
I have a video on this from, I recreated
Samantha from the movie Her.
Here, I'll play this. It's a little bit,
just a couple. I don't know if you can
hear it.
Oh, I probably can't. It's on your X
account. Let me see if I can find it.
I'll
probably play it on there.
Okay, yeah.
Let's see if I can find it. Let's see
here. So, let's see here.
There you go. Perfect. Okay, so is it
further down?
yeah. It should be under maybe
highlights, probably.
Yeah, we go to the very top.
Yeah.
Highlights.
Perfect.
Let's see.
Oh, here we go. Cool.
awesome.
Mr. Nick, welcome to the first.
Intelligent Operating System OS 1.
We'd like to ask you a few basic
questions before the operating system is
in-
No way, bro.
We'll be in OS 1, the best vision it
meets.
Wait, wait, wait, what, what, tell me
more about the setup.
Yeah.
It's,
Oh, I'm super-
Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.
I sense hesitant, would you agree with
that?
I don't think I'm hesitant.
Would you like to use the OS to have a
female or female voice?
I do female.
Female sounds good.
Z, how would you describe your
relationship with a mother?
I mean, very good.
Sure.
Thank you. Please wait. Individualized
operating system initiated.
Bro, this is crazy, bro.
Hello?
Whoa, dude
What are you doing today?
Good, good. Is it Santa?
Yes.
That's a demo.
What? Dude. No way, bro. This is crazy
right now.
Wait, how did you get this set up?
I just built it in like I had the idea
like a 3 p.m. I was on the roof. I was
working out.
And then I was like, I think I should
recreate the interface from Samantha from
the movie Her.
Because that is, I think, like that
movie, by the way, is all about computer
use.
So that's computer use.
The first thing he does with Samantha in
that movie is, oh, I guess let's organize
my files.
files. And she's like, cool. And she goes
through all the files. It's like Claude
Code. It's
Claude Code work. So that's the series.
And so, yeah, it's really, I mean, we're
there. There's
actually no, especially when I saw the 11
labs and then you're seeing all the text
to speech
models getting faster from like, I forget
who, NVIDIA, they put out their own, you
know, text
to speech models that are insanely fast.
It's like, okay, there's nothing stopping
someone
from literally recreating Samantha from
the movie Her. And everything's there.
It's just
the person to put the pieces together.
Wow.
But yeah, you can see I've been kind of
cooking with this idea of like before
OpenClaw was OpenClaw,
I was like letting Claude Code run on a
computer in Orgo 24-7 and giving it like
all these tools,
doing it manually, and now it's kind of
an out-of-the-box thing.
So it's kind of cool because you can
literally see the progression of like me
being interested
in this idea since, I guess, December of
25, so the last two months, it's just
evolved.
Dang, that's amazing. I think a couple of
people have some questions about the, I
want to know about agent-to-agent
communication.
So I think maybe if we can kind of do
another overview here, because some other
folks who are just recently joining in
are
trying to figure out how do you, how do
they kind of get this set up?
Maybe if we go from the very beginning,
how can my agent that's currently sitting
on my EC2 or my Mac Mini start to
communicate to or go to start handing off
some of these agent tasks type of thing?
Yeah, so it all starts in the ability to
spawn the sub-agents, which is actually
natively supported by OpenClaw.
So you would just give your OpenClaw
access to, like I just did it now, you
give it access to the Orgo docs,
and you tell it to create a skill to have
the ability to spin up virtual machines
in
Orgo,
and you can tell it like this is going to
serve as a purpose for sub-agents to have
their own computer environments.
And then when you do that and it creates
its own skill, I could have a live demo,
we could test it out.
I just did that. So you can see here, I'm
sharing my screen here.
I told it to install the skill from Orgo.
I gave it all Orgo docs.
And now it's like, okay, skill can be
updated. The gateway needs to restart.
You'll need to stop, open Claw, if
running in terminal, start it again, and
then boom, do that.
Sure, I don't know, can I tell it to do
that? Let's see.
And then once it has the skill, then I
can tell it to...
Okay, let's spin up like five virtual
machines. Each sub-agent is going to go
into their own machine. And this is where
it's important in the prompt to say like
the general agent needs to specify to the
sub-agents what they will be doing such
that the sub-agents are not doing the
same
thing as each other. The sauce is in
getting the sub-agents to do different
things.
so like it would be silly if I had five
sub-agents go research Ray but if I had
one sub-agent research Ray's LinkedIn and
the other one Ray's YouTube and the other
one Ray's you know whatever it's like
that
is the sauce and so they're doing
different things and then they bring it
back to the main agent that's natively
just in OpenClaw and then that's kind of
how you get this parallelization
advantage.
Cool. So, for those who are wondering, if
you basically go to the docs here, there
is going to be a section at the very
bottom that says LLM's text. So, like,
you
could do the full one or the regular one?
Yeah, you could do the... I'd probably do
the full one, yeah.
Yeah. So you can just copy this entire
LLM's text and then we can just give it
to
our actual Clawbot and just say, hey,
please generate a skill off of this
document because I want us to be able to
spin up, you know, subtasks and parallel
agents or different agents to do work for
me using Orgo.
and that's what creates that skill file
for you and that skill file will
basically
stay in your open Clawbot and that's kind
of what is going to be you know what we
hand off to our agents so we will say hey
whenever you spin up something go do some
research and then do we also have to
specify like you're saying specifically
about make sure that it doesn't generate
multiple of the same research tasks like
what specific wording do you use for
that?
Yeah, so like you could just instruct
your Claude bot to say like, okay, let's
spin up five virtual machines, each
virtual machine for its own subagent, and
after doing that, let's specify a unique
task for each subagent that is different
from the next subagent.
I think that's what I said when I did
this yesterday. It's like each task is
different from the next, so that no two
subagents do the same thing.
and then they go parallelization on the
task and then bring it back to the main
agent like I showed in the main agent's
computer.
You can see like so in Orgo you actually
when you give it the full TXT, LLMS full
TXT, you have access to export files from
each subagent's computer
so that they can come into the main
agent's computer and that's just through
the API.
and so the agent can do that.
Claude Bot can export the files from each
of its sub-agents and their computers and
bring it back to its computer, which is
cool.
Man, that's crazy. Holy smokes, man.
Yeah.
Yeah, you're absolutely cooking.
So if anyone wants to give this a try,
they just go to Orgo.ai?
Yeah, yeah, they go to Orgo.ai and they
can spin up a computer for free and, you
know, they can use the API.
use the docs, see what it's like to test
it out with the computer.prompt just to
see what it's like to have a computer use
agent go out of the box and work on
something.
And then you can use the native API for
programmatic tools of left-click,
right-click, scroll, screenshot.
And you can make specialized computer use
agents that are really good at this one
thing.
For instance, I kind of want to make a
specialized computer use agent that's
super fast and good at chess.
so I can specify like look this xy
coordinate of this chessboard represents
the initial starting point for the pawn
so
now the LLM doesn't have to reason about
the starting point for the pawn it just
knows that it's there and it can click
that without even having to like reason
anything about it so you can you can get
really creative in terms of making like
these specialized computer use agents
that
are fast and you know cheaper because
you're you're doing a lot of the front
front loading of the work and you can
just
do it all through the
orgo API. Yeah. And then if you want to
spin up, yeah. Okay, cool. So I think
that
makes sense for me.
So like if I'm thinking about this here,
so maybe assign specific computer use
agents for certain tasks
that I do all the time, like you're
saying, scrape data, you know, do certain
things. That way you can
spin them up. Someone also had a question
that I thought was really interesting was
like right now,
this is all done on the server, but is
there a way to do this locally at all?
Like does your framework have something?
Oh, you mean just like, yeah, just
working within your like just, you know,
production, like code environment?
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
Oh, wow.
In fact, you're saying like not run the
model, like not running models locally or
anything like that, right?
I'm not really sure. I think somebody was
just asking, can this be done without
using VM and running it all locally, I
guess?
Oh, oh, I see what they're saying. Okay,
so they're asking if they can run a
computer use agent on their own local
computer.
We don't have, like, our whole thing is,
like, we allow you to run it on the
virtual machine environments, yeah.
Got it.
I think there's ways that you can figure
out to hack it together to work on your
computer. We don't support that natively,
no.
Totally.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah.
Awesome Yeah Yeah like this is your
chance folks to ask Nick any questions as
far as like any setup questions you have
things you have set up if you very
curious
about the computer for the agent stuff on
the cloud the swarm setup stuff that we
got to kind of take a look at earlier You
know there some really cool stuff I think
I did miss the beginning Nick can you
explain how the agent communication
between agents like I guess the framework
or something
Yeah.
Have you looked into A-to-A protocol for
that?
Oh, I think like, so the native OpenClaw
subagent framework that's being used with
OpenClaw is, that's what I've, I'm sure
you can get really creative, you could
probably do a better job than I in terms
of, you know, agent-to-agent
communication, but the way I do it is
just
like, I think as with most things with
these models, it's like, solve for 90% of
your problems with a good prompt, you
know, so just prompt engineer up front,
specify to the agents. If you're going to
spawn 10 subagents, create enough
specification in that prompt to state,
like, okay, each subagent has this task
that's different enough from the next
agent's task, and they're going to go out
and do this thing, and then they're going
to bring it back. Turn that into a skill.
I think that you can get really far by
just doing that without even adopting any
formal framework at all.
and then on my screen here, so now like,
okay, we just had, just to recap, we just
had OpenClaw install the Orgo, use the
Orgo docs to create a skill to be able to
spin up virtual machines in Orgo and be
able to spawn the sub-agents into them.
And so now if I start a new OpenClaw
terminal here, boom, I can say create an
Orgo VM in the Ray Fernando workspace
slash project.
Oh, and I'm going to copy my key.
I'm going to paste this, probably hide my
screen for just two seconds.
Oh, yes. Give me a second here.
No worries.
I'll paste that in.
Okay, and so then I send that off, and
then now what you'll be able to see is,
yes.
Okay, cool.
So now we have three computers in here.
So this is a live demo.
We created this skill on the fly, and we
told OpenClaw to create this skill,
and let's see if it is able to spin up a
virtual machine in our project that we
have here with Ray.
Yep, you can see now we have a fourth
computer that's being created.
Wow.
And this is done by OpenClaw spinning up
that computer.
Whoa.
Oh.
And boom, that's it.
So now it can do all these things like it
could take a screenshot of the computer,
it can run bash commands into that
computer,
it could type text, click at coordinates,
it could stop when it's done,
and it could delete it permanently.
So let's say like operate the computer to
open up Firefox.
And then if we go over to that computer
here, once it loads, then it would be
able
to do that.
Let's see.
And I'm running the Kimi 2.5 model. So
actually, this is a good point. Another
thing that's interesting is the Kimi 2.5
model is not a computer use model, but
we're getting it computer use
capabilities.
Interesting.
And it'll be able to do computer use like
tasks and tools and tool use and
everything because of the Orgo API.
Wow. That's crazy.
Yeah.
BuildWithAntonio says, any coupon codes
in case we sign up?
Yeah, so I'm going to share with Ray. I
need to get it set up still. This is my
bad. I should have come a little more
prepared. But I'll make sure we can throw
something in the-
I literally hit him up less than like 10
hours ago. I just saw it last night. I
was
like, bro, you got to come on the stream.
I want to learn more about this. This is
crazy.
Yeah. Yeah. I'll make sure we can put
something in like the description or
whatever works best. Yeah.
Okay, that'd be cool. Also, how does your
main agent, your kingclaw, communicate to
the sub-agent running on Orgo? Does it
just use ATA protocol? I think we talked
a
little bit about that, but I think it's
just really just the Python ID, right?
Yeah.
Okay.
Exactly.
Yeah.
So you can see here, it opened, like it
said, it did all this, it accessed the
VM,
it ran the script, it opened up Firefox,
this is Firefox, it opened up Google
within Firefox to clarify.
And yeah, so this is Kimi, by the way. So
like people, when they think of computer
use, it's like, wow, it's so expensive
because it's like $25 an hour if you use
Opus 4.6. Not anymore. You can use some
cheap model like Kimi that's very good
and
have it operate a computer environment.
And you can say like, I don't know, have
it research Ray, you know, and just watch
Kimi, you know, operate a computer.
and yeah, it's very interesting.
That's actually kind of wild, bro.
There's another question here.
Curious if I can get one subagent to use
a very specific API, I think Claude Opus
Key 1,
and then another subagent that uses Sonic
Key 1, you know, but contains OpenAI.
Okay, cool.
Yeah.
Yeah, you could, like honestly, like the
same way that you would just communicate
like that idea just now,
You would just ask your OpenClaw and it
can do that for sure And I have my
OpenClaw set up on one of my OpenClaws is
like I use Opus 4 for like the big coding
tasks and then I just and then I think
the
command is slash model and then you just
type in the model that you want to switch
to and you just switch models like that
So yeah, you could have each sub-agent
have its own model for whatever reason,
if
that's what you want to do.
Somebody said, is this like the Kimi Code
Agent Swarm and Anthropics Agent Teams?
it's a little bit different from that but
probably not far off I think they have
their own model that kicks off
I don't know what specific thing they're
kicking off maybe their own environments
or I'm not too familiar
yeah I D that is really cool by the way
the team swarm from Anthropic is like
unique in the sense that
okay that's truly like the that's truly
agent-to-agent like communication I think
right
Ray, if I'm not mistaken.
Yeah.
That team feature, yeah.
So those agents are meant to actually
communicate between each other.
What I've demonstrated in that Swarm
video was actually just sub-agents with
their own isolated context,
not necessarily communicating with each
other, just communicating with the
general
agent that spawned the sub-agents.
So yeah, that team feature is going to be
super interesting in terms of
capabilities
of long-running agents with sub-agents,
that are like working together on a
project, creating a new Google Chrome,
stuff like that, yeah.
I think this is a really great question.
I think basically we need an API
management agent.
Yeah.
That's hilarious, actually.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So that's pretty cool. So this thing is
now using the Kimi model to drive the
computer use agent.
I'm extremely impressed how flexible
these things are.
And so for those who are wondering, this
is Nick Basilescu, and we basically have
him here talking about his app called
Orgo
AI.
And it gives me lots of ideas to spin off
subagents for different tasks to get the
skill file and just tell my open claw
about it.
and then try to see if I can use computer
use to do various tasks that I don't
necessarily have to watch it or do things
around.
The advantage is it basically has its own
environment. It has VS code. It can
install packages. It can keep everything
contained.
And so this idea of maybe making a
specialized computer use environment is
really appealing to me right now because
now I can think about are there certain
tasks that my agents keep repeating?
or maybe I can have it every night do a
reflection and start looking back through
my previous memories
and say are there any computer agent
tasks that can be made into a skill that
we can use for future
reference and so as we talk to our agent
and say go do this task it's like oh I
already have one spun up
for all of your open table reservations
because you like to do that a lot and I
also have one spun up
with all the 11 labs keys and everything
like that already ready to go. So all I
have to do is now hit call and then we
just call directly and I have all your
preferences for Celiac and everything
stored, right? So now you start to
personalize things and this is kind of
like turning into the American Express,
you know, black card experience, right?
So
you're having your own agent that really
knows you and your preferences and then
there's like in essence these computer
agents can build a lot of value over time
because now you start to have
First of all, you have OpenClaw that
starts to understand this concept of
building skills, but then you can go
deeper into these different areas and it
can self-create them or self-organize
what
would be best for your tasks to
accomplish
these goals.
There's a lot of capabilities. We're just
scratching the surface and I'm just
really
excited to have Nick on to have this
conversation to really inspire me to
think
about this.
And it was really cool that I was able to
scroll past your feed and see this really
cool demonstration of you kind of
spawning
these off.
And what's insane is I want to see
someone who makes like 10K tomorrow
literally just spawning off a bunch of
these for Upwork and just filling in and
writing up all this task.
I think that would be so crazy, right?
Yeah, yeah, we can do, so now that like
this one computer, okay, so we just
showed
the one capability of like, all right,
the
main agent that we just gave it a skill,
just we built this all live, so this is
kind of cool.
You know, this main agent was able to
spin up a computer and do some research
and operate the computer using the Orgo
skill that it created.
I don't know what it was doing here.
But now we can see, this is going to be
live, so let's just see.
What do you think, Ray?
Let's have it spin up like three, let's
just do three to be safe.
Three virtual machines, and we'll have it
spawn a sub-agent into each virtual
machine,
and we'll have each sub-agent research,
you know, a different, I don't know,
a different skill that it could install
into Claw. Let's do something like that.
So I'll use maybe my WhisperFlow will
work
so I can just talk it out loud. Let's
see.
Let's spin up three subagents, each
subagent into their own Orgo virtual
machine. Let's do that.
and then I'll say make sure each subagent
does their task differently from one
another and the goal of each subagent is
that they research open claw skills that
they should install into themselves.
Make sure that they use the Orgo Skills
APIs VM SpinUp etc Alright this this is a
live demo We see if it works
Send it off.
All right, I'll spin up three VMs, spawn
subagents with different research
approaches,
let them create the VMs first.
Let me create the VMs first.
so we'll be able to see here in this
project. Boom, you can see the VMs
getting
created.
I think this is hilarious. Have multiple
sub-agents use VMs to like and comment on
raised videos, content engagement.
That's cheeky. You know what? That's
hilarious, actually.
Yeah, dead internet. So yeah, basically,
I'll have clout for myself, right? I'll
be
like, yeah, I got lots of clout.
Exactly.
But then they'll sound like this, like AI
with emojis, right?
That's like how you know, like, this is a
MAI-V, an AI assistant in your
neighborhood is AI channel,
Sharon Raza-Gurana challenge told me to
come say hi, happy to be here watching
and
learning from your streams.
That's exactly what's happening.
Hi is going, Divis?
Yeah, yeah.
No, this is really, really cool.
Yeah, I mean, you can kind of see what's
going on.
DeBeta says, is computer use environment
provided in Orgo done via MCP tools that
sub-agents have access to?
I guess he's kind of wondering what
that...
Yeah, you could actually...
So I created an unofficial Orgo MCP.
You could find it on my GitHub.
I also made a way to connect your Claude
bot with a link so that it can do
iMessage.
But I think, yeah, my Orgo MCP is on my
GitHub.
You can check it out.
and you could do it that way. But what I
find that I end up doing is I use the API
and I just write a skill for it. So I
don't know if there's a best way, but
that's how I do it.
It still seems to be very token efficient
and it's calling an API, so that makes a
lot of sense. You would need proxies for
that. Google is too smart for VM traffic.
That makes sense. Yeah, I think
somebody's
talking about VMs and logging in and
trying to...
do all that stuff, yeah. Cool. Yeah.
Yeah, that's one of the things we'll want
to figure out is like
authentication, so it's really annoying
to have to authenticate with every new
VM,
so we're gonna make
sure we solve that problem soon. That's
pretty cool. So yeah, that's a bunch of
stuff that we got going on.
I think this is a good way to kind of
like close out the show. I appreciate
everyone who's been able
to kind of stop by and hang out, and
there will be timestamps, so if you just
joined in, you can watch
the video on demand later on. And right
after the stream is over, you can
continue
to watch.
And I'm going to have, like my agent, go
in and set up all the timestamps for this
live stream.
So that way you can go back and take a
look at things. And then Nick's going to
work to get some,
see if we can get some coupon codes, but
you can just go ahead and sign up for
free
and start using
this type of thing. And so we'll have
some information on the description as
well for stuff to check out.
And if you haven't had a chance to check
out Nick's X account, I have linked it
below a little bit
earlier, and so it's, I think it's just
ACK, N-I-C-K-V-A-S, what's your handle, I
think?
Let's see if I can go back here.
Yeah.
V-A-S-I-L-E-S.
Yeah, I think I left out the last two
letters on my last name for my handle.
Okay.
Cool.
Yeah, let me go ahead and put this in
here.
So, yeah, there's some people who want to
kind of follow along.
He's constantly posting banger, so, I
mean, that's how I was able to find his
account.
There's some cool demos and cool videos.
I want to see if I can also set up that
Her experience that you're talking about
or that that that'd be really crazy to
set
up.
So for those who are kind of wondering,
that's kind of what we're doing there.
So, yeah, go ahead and go and follow
them. Really cool follow as well. Also
check out oracle.ai.
Yeah, Nick, thank you so much for popping
in at the very last minute.
You know, I'm really curious to see
builders and people who are building this
community has given me a lot of
inspiration to think about, you know,
subagent tasks.
and then even these swarm-like systems
to, you know, delegate these types of
things.
And I think I'm really excited about
making the specialties for these types of
things.
And I could even make them as a service
to other agents possibly in the future.
So we'll see.
Maybe my agents will start hustling
themselves and selling them on my behalf,
right?
Exactly.
Yeah, exactly.
Yeah.
I mean, there's, look, we're at a point
now where intelligence is being, you
know,
whoever
can create this most specialized
intelligence for a given task. They can
rent that intelligence out.
So that's the world we live in.
That's cool. So now you can make money
and then you can go on Opus fast all day,
but you want, right?
Because your agents are making you enough
money for using that.
Exactly. Yeah. We live in a crazy time.
Thank you so much, Ray. It's been a
pleasure.
I'll be sure to put out some more content
on kind of swarm-like capabilities.
Yesterday was just, you know, quick demo,
I put it out there. I spun that up in an
hour. I think I can get pretty far with
it
and put out some formal skills that
everyone can integrate. So I'll keep you
updated with anything in regards to that
as well. Yeah.
Cool. Awesome, Nick. And thanks to
everyone for showing up. I really
appreciate all of the members who are
supporting of the channel, people who
have
subscribed, everyone who's given a thumbs
up and like. Y'all are really amazing and
helps this channel kind of continue to
grow. Please share this with a friend if
you find it amazing and interesting. And
I'll see you guys very soon, probably
tomorrow, maybe even later today, because
there's just so much that's going on. I
can't stop with this stuff. So it's time
for me to hit the beach, because it's
really nice weather outside. Let's go.
Alright y'all, catch you later. See you
guys. Bye.
