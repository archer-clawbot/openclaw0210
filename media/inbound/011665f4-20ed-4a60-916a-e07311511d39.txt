SEO is the new way to rank number one in


AI search engines. Not Google not being


AI search engines like Chat GPT,


Plexity, Claude, and AIO overviews and


the ones everyone is now using instead


of Google. And here's the crazy part. No


one is talking about this yet. Over the


next few minutes, I'm going to show you


exactly how I use YouTube videos to rank


inside AI search results. You can see an


example here. We're ranking on the first


page of Google one, two, three times on


Google for that particular keyword. And


you can see how easy it is to really


pull your videos in and get results with


this. The powerful thing about videos is


they can rank inside Google, but they


can also rank inside AIO views. So, for


example, if we type in notebook LM


update here, it pulls in an AIO view.


And who does it link to? It links to


Google and it also links to my videos as


well. So, videos are really powerful for


ranking with SEO. You can also see me


ranking once there as well. And then


also on the first page of Google as


well, right? And so this is a powerful


way to start getting ranking really


quickly. Okay? And what I'm going to


show you today is basically how you can


do this without being on camera, without


spending thousands on video production,


without needing any technical skills.


And I will show you how to automate AI


avatar videos that actually rank videos


that show up when someone asks chat or


perplexity a question about your niche.


And think about this for a second,


right? Billions of searches are


happening every single day, right? On AI


platforms, right? and your video could


be the one that gets recommended. Not


because you paid for ads, not because


you got lucky with the algorithm, but


because you understood how AI search


engines actually find and recommend


content. So, I'm going to walk you


through my exact system, the free tools,


the prompts, the 30-day to get your


first videos ranking in AI search, and


you will see everything live on screen,


just the actual process I use, so that


by the end of this, you have a complete


framework that you can copy and steal


from me. Whether you run a service


business, sell products, you have an


agency, or you just want more eyeballs


on your content, this works even if


you've never made a video before. Let's


get straight into it. So, the method


that we're actually going to be using


today is something called the video AI


domination framework. Okay? And one


thing to note here is that AI search


engines, they don't work like Google,


right? They don't just look at keywords


and backlinks. They understand context,


relevance, authority in a completely


different way. So, when someone asks ch


question, it pulls from sources it


trusts. Now, YouTube is one of those


sources. Perplexi actively searches


YouTube for answers. Let me show you an


example of this. So, we go on to Plexi


here and we'll put like notebook AI


updates, something like that. What you


can see here is that it actually sources


updates from YouTube, right? So, if we


look at the reviewed sources here, you


can see that it's pulled in three


different videos from YouTube inside


Perplexity, right? So, if we have a look


here, you've got this video and this is


a video from Julian Goldie SEO, as you


can see. So, that's my channel right


there. If we go over to this video, you


can also see that's another video from


us as well, ranking inside Plexity,


right? And so we're ranking on Google


and we're also ranking inside Perplexity


using this method. And Claude references


video content in its responses, too. So


this is a massive shift. The game has


changed and most people haven't caught


on yet. Now, why does video crush text


AI search? AI systems love video content


for three reasons. Number one, video has


multiple signals. you know, it's got


audio, visual transcripts, engagement


metrics. There's more data points for AI


to understand your content. Second,


video builds trust faster. So, AI


systems recognize that video creators


put more effort in and that signals


authority. Number three, video gets


cited more. So, when AI needs to


recommend a source, video feels more


complete than a blog post. And bear in


mind, AI can generate a blog post at any


time. It doesn't really need to


reference blog posts, but it doesn't


create long videos with interesting case


studies. Right? One of the things people


going to say is I need expensive


equipment to make good videos. But


actually AI avatar videos, create


professional videos for free. You can


actually go on to something like


notebook and you can generate videos for


free using this method and then rank


them on Google which then in turn ranks


inside AI search engines and other


places. Right? So for example, if we


have a look here, we've got the video on


the right hand side. This was actually


from a video I generated earlier today.


This is actually AI narrated and it's a


full long video like 6 minutes 26


seconds. And you can see this runs


people through the topic that we're


trying to rank for, right? So, how to


watch football like a scout. And so, it


creates the design, it narrates a video,


it generates everything, and all we need


to do is pull in the sources that we


want to reference. And then we can


easily download this, as you can see,


and we're good to go. You could upload


that to YouTube. The other method that


you can see is that on our YouTube


channel, for example, if we check out


this YouTube channel, we quite often use


AI avatar videos inside our content.


Right now, how do you do that? We


actually have a full method inside the


AI profit boardroom that shows you


exactly how to do this in the AI avatar


video section. If you go to the


classroom here inside the AI profit


boardroom link in the comments


description, go to the playbook and then


scroll down to the AI avatar video


section and you can find the right


there. Okay, so if you want to learn our


process for doing this, you can check it


out inside the AR profit boardroom. But


it's quite easy to automate videos.


Again, you can do it for free with


notebook. I've already shown you how to


do that and so you can create


professional videos for free. So it's a


really powerful way. Now some people


said YouTube is too competitive to start


right now. AI search is a new platform


with almost zero competition. When I


started out in SEO, everyone said Google


was too competitive. Too many websites,


too many established players. I ignored


them, built an agency, helped my mom


retire, and now I reach over 100 million


people per year across all platforms.


Right? So the lesson is competition is


not your problem. Timing is your


opportunity. AI search is where YouTube


was 10 years ago. It's wide open, right?


And waiting for someone to claim the


space. And that someone could be you.


Also, some people will say like video


SEO takes months to see results. But the


new belief really is that AI search can


surface your content within days, right?


So, if we go back here and we look at


this content, guess what's ranking


number one for this particular keyword?


Well, it's my video right here. When was


the video created? 4 hours ago, as you


can see right there. And so, this


content ranks very quickly indeed. And


that was within 4 hours. So, traditional


SEO is very slow, right? And I know this


better than anyone. I run an SEO agency.


We tell clients to expect 90 days


minimum. But AI search is a different


game. Complexity updates in real time.


Chat GPT pulls in from recent sources


and your video could get cited within


days of publishing. And this is why a


block like 100 minutes plus per day


every day to focus on the biggest


constraint in my business. And right now


that constraint for most people is not


being visible in AI search of people say


I need thousands of subscribers. But AI


search cares about content quality not


subscriber counts. I have 300,000 plus


subscribers on YouTube and here's what I


noticed is like some of my newer videos


with fewer views actually get cited by


AI more than my viral ones, right? And


why is that? It's because AI looks at


relevance and quality, not vanity


metrics. So, you know, a video with 500


views that perfectly answers a specific


question will beat a video with 500,000


views that's too broad. And this is


great news for you so you can compete


from day one. So, let's talk about a


90-day framework in terms of how you can


implement this. You want to start


finding questions that people are


looking for. I actually got a prompt to


automate that. The other thing you can


do is you can go into Google and you can


just look through the auto suggests and


see what people are searching around


your niche. Right? So if I'm in the AI


niche and I'm trying to create content


around notebookm


like all these different updates around


it, right? And that's how you do the


keyword research. What you can do is you


can go to chat GPT. You can plug in a


keyword here and then you can go from


there. Wilty says, "What can AI money


lab help me do until I'm ready for the


AI profit lab?" Yeah. So that like


inside the AI success lab, right? If you


go here, what you're going to find is


like a number one, you get a community


of 42,000 people that you just connect


with instantly. So, you can post in the


community, ask for help and support. You


also get access to our free AI


automation master classes like you see


on pretty much every single AI


technology out there. This section, we


update it daily with the new updates.


So, everything you need to know about AI


is inside this section. We have a full


section on what you can see here, right?


So, how to make money with AI. And then


also inside the classroom, you can see


that we have a full section on AI SEO as


well. So everything you need to succeed


AI is inside this community and it's


completely free link in the comments


description. So if we go back to chat


now we can say at a market researcher


put your niche in there. So we're going


to put in for example like SEO and then


we can start publishing this and just


getting some keywords right says looks


like great content. Thanks very much.


And then you see it finds a bunch of


keywords you could potentially rank for.


Super specific. I'll almost say they're


too long tail but if you want to start


somewhere you can start there. All


right. And then if you want to generate


the videos well you can use hey genen or


you can use notebook them for ranking


and you just make sure on the content


itself for example if we have a look at


Julian go agents that you include the


keywords inside the content right so you


can see here keyword right there right


frontloaded inside the title keyword


right there boom here we go right if we


actually type that keyword on Google


let's have a look here so how to do this


we'll see whether it ranks and let's see


what we got here yeah you can see that


my LinkedIn article is ranking for that


keyword on the first page of Google


along with that page as well, right? And


bear in mind these pages are created


from the video content itself. So if we


have a look at this page, you can see


our video is embedded on the page. So


it's pretty easy to create the content


and then just rank it either with your


blog or with your video as well. Cool


thing is like you can create blogs from


the videos and then rank those as well.


So that's basically it. That's the whole


process of doing this. How to implement


it. I've talked about the 30-day


framework and the old way versus the new


way. The old way was spent thousands on


camera equipment and lighting. The new


way is you can use free AI avatar videos


to create professional videos instantly.


The old way was you need to look good on


camera and be comfortable speaking. The


new way is AI avatars handle the


delivery. You just write the script. The


new way is generating videos that come


ready to upload. And then when it comes


to ranking inside Google or other AI


search engines, the old way was like


waiting 6 to 12 months for Google to


rank your content. The new AI search can


surface your video days as I've shown


you today. Right? The old way was


competing against millions of websites


for keywords. The new way AI search is


almost zero competition rate. The old


way was needing expensive backlinks to


rank. The new way is AI search values


content quality and link metrics. The


old way was fighting algorithm changes


to tank your websites overnight. And the


new way is like AI searches focus on


relevance, not gaming the system. So you


got all the strategies, all the


processes, all the systems from today,


the 30-day plan and how to implement


this yourself. If you want us to do SEO
