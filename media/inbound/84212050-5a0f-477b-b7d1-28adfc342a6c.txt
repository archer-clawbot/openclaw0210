briefs, this means you can upload


competitor pages, analyze them, and


build better content strategies in


minutes instead of days. Now, let me


show you how to actually use this for


SEO. Here's the workflow. First, you


find the top ranking pages for your


target keyword. Let's say you want to


rank for something related to AI


automation for businesses. You grab the


URLs of the top 10 to 20 results from


Google. Then, you upload them into


Notebook LM. You can also add your own


draft content. Any FAQs you've


collected, research notes, whatever


you've got. Once everything's uploaded,


here's where it gets good. You give


Notebook LM a prompt, something like


this. Analyze the content gaps. search


intent and keyword clusters for AI


automation services. Output a detailed


SEO outline with title tags, meta


descriptions, H2 headings, and a


structure for a 1500word article. And


boom. Notebook LM does all the heavy


lifting. It compares your competitors,


identifies what they're covering, finds


the gaps you can fill, spots the


keywords they're using, and builds you a


rank ready outline. But it doesn't stop


there. You can also generate a data


table. This shows you how your content


stacks up against the competition, what


topics they cover that you don't, what


angles they're missing that you can hit.


It's like having X-ray vision into the


SER, then you export that table to


Google Sheets, use it to build schema


markup, create FAQ sections, plan


internal linking, and the whole nine


yards. And one more thing, if you're


creating all this content with Notebook


LM, but nobody is finding it online,


you've got a traffic problem. That's


where SEO comes in. If you want more


leads, more traffic, and more sales, my

let us handle your back links while you


focus on growing your business. Right,


let's do a live example. I'm going to


show you exactly how this works in real


time. Let's say I want to rank for AI


automation community. First, I search


that keyword on Google. I copy the URLs


of the top 10 results. Then, I head to


Notebook LM and create a new notebook. I


paste all those URLs as sources.


Notebookm imports them instantly. Now I


go to the chat and type this prompt.


Create an SEO outline for AI automation


community. Include H1, H2, and H3


headings. Add 30 LSI keywords. Include


eight frequently asked questions.


Structure it for 1500 words. Target


search intent for people looking to join


or learn about AI automation


communities. Notebook LM processes


everything. In about 30 seconds, I get a


full outline. And it's got the title,


the meta description, the introduction


angle, all the H2 and H3 headings, a


list of LSI keywords like AI business


tools, automation workflows, community


support, AI learning resources, and FAQ


section with questions like what is an


AI automation community? How can AI


automation help my business? And what


tools are used in AI automation? Now,


here's the magic. I copy that outline. I


paste it into chat GPT or claude. I tell


it to write a full 1500word blog post


based on this structure and in a few


minutes I've got a complete article.


It's optimized, it's structured, it's


ready to publish. And because the


outline was built from actual top


ranking content, it has a way better


chance of ranking. We've tested this


process dozens of times. It works. Let's


talk about some pro tips. First, use the


multilingual feature if you're targeting


international markets. Notebook LM


supports over 50 languages so you can


analyze Spanish SERs, French SERs,


German SERs, whatever you need. Build


outlines for each language. Then get


them translated and published. It's a


massive opportunity most people ignore.


Second, use the visual tools,


infographics, mind maps. These aren't


just pretty, they're functional. You can


turn your SEO research into visual


content. Use it for YouTube thumbnails,


social media posts, client


presentations. For example, create a


mind map showing all the keyword


clusters for AI automation. Then


screenshot it, post it on Twitter or


LinkedIn. Instant engagement and it


positions you as an authority. Third,


scale. This notebook LM lets you create


multiple notebooks. We're talking 50


100, even more. So, if you're running an


agency or managing multiple clients, you


can batch your SEO research, create a


notebook for each client, upload their


competitors, generate outlines for their


target keywords, then hand those


outlines to your writers or AI tools.


You've just automated 80% of your


content strategy. Here's another cool


trick. Use deep research for automated


SER analysis. Instead of manually


visiting every top ranking page, deep


research does it for you. It scans the


web, finds the most relevant sources,


pulls in citations, and builds a report


you can trust. Then you import that


report into your notebook. Combine it


with your competitor URLs, and you've


got everything you need to dominate that


keyword. This is next level stuff. Same


process, competitor analysis, outline


generation, full article. They jump from


not ranking at all to position five in


under a month. This stuff works and it's


way faster than traditional methods.


Compare this to manual research. Before


Notebook LM, you'd spend hours opening


tabs, reading competitor content, taking


notes, building outlines by hand. It was


slow, it was tedious, and you'd probably


miss stuff. Now, you upload the URLs,


give it a prompt, and you're done in 5


minutes. You're saving hours every


single day. And the quality is better


because Notebook LM catches patterns


you'd miss manually. Here's what I want


you to do. Go to Notebook LM right now.


It's free. Create an account if you


don't have one. Pick a keyword you want


to rank for. Find the top 10 results on


Google, upload them to Notebook LM, then


use the prompt I gave you earlier.


Analyze gaps, build an outline, export


it, and create your content. If you do


this once, you'll see why this is so


powerful. If you do it 10 times, you'll


never go back to manual research. And


look, if you want to rank number one,


get more customers, and actually win


with AI SEO, this is your next move.
