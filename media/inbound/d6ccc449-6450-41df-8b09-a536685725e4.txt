today I'm going to be interviewing teos


spect about how he grew his agency from


Zer to


€120,000 per month as an SEO agency in


Germany he's going to be revealing his


exact process to 2x's monthly Revenue


how he solved his sales problems and


it's really not what you think plus his


Lone Wolf mindset that nearly killed his


SEO agency plus how he fixed it teo's a


client we've been working together for a


while now and I'm really excited to show


you what he shares today let's get into


it where do you scale to with your


agency sitting right now at Munich


Germany and me with my brother together


we've been doing SEO work almost 14


years which means that's when he started


so it was 2010 back then and I was still


like in University after school I was


studying economics and I really hated it


so I had a hard time this was a time


when he started with SEO and um he


brought into some masterminds back then


for a lot of money he then started


building out some local Legion sites


which we still have so we Rank and rent


them and then during the time where he


put all the SEO strategy into these


sites I was finishing up my University


and then I got a job at a startup they


were selling chin so chin online chin


and tonic and so he gave me all the SEO


knowledge and told me to implement it on


a company and back then they had no no


website they had no no Amazon listing so


I started building out the website and I


started building out the Amazon listing


so in the end like 3 years later we've


been ranking for chin on page one in


Google Germany and also we've been the


bestselling product in the whole grocery


space on Amazon there was only like the


the apal baby milk which is for children


it's one of the best sellers on Amazon


was still selling more but then it was


also the chin so why I'm saying this is


because I had some time before my agency


where I could Implement and I'm really


grateful for the job I had to use this


knowledge but then after two three years


there I started with my personal brand


Teo and that's where we build it out the


the agency for ranking for just generic


keywords like SEO freelance or SEO


agency or SEO agentur which is agency in


German and ever since then we've been


ranking for SEO Munich so zo Mion on


page one of Google and also the three


pack for years now outranking all the


biggest SEO agencies out there and


that's how we generate leads dayto day


it's awesome to see an SEO agency


actually do SEO as well but to rank top


in Germany I can imagine that's not easy


like you're competing with some big


agencies in that space was a tough it's


a tough road to get there and lot of


fails and lot of energy sucking moments


to be honest and there's a lot of


investment not just time and energy but


also failure and then and successful


moments but in the end it was just pure


patience and then building out content


and links and without doubting this for


years and years yeah that makes sense


how you found because I know a lot of


people a lot of people particularly


resio agencies scared of putting


themselves out there I think for example


the attention it can attract some of it


some of it good some of it bad Etc some


people are worried what other people


think about them if they try and


position themselves as an expert for


selling their services how have you


found the journey towards building your


personal brand I guess like it it was


like also a personal development process


of my own Persona because in the end I


had a hard time to get visible and to


get a lot of traction online it's also


scary at the beginning because you be


putting yourself out there and you feel


like oh what the hell are they thinking


what could might might happen to me what


is the competition doing with me is it


really going to work and so on which is


one part and then the other part is what


if I'm failing what if I'm not


succeeding what if SEO is just I don't


know like a crazy mind Theory and


is not working and then it really took


some some personal growth and


development to to stick to it and then


at some point I had this twisting and


the switching moment where I thought


okay I'm ready to do this and and get


more visible and as soon as I was more


comfortable with the situation myself


and we had more like ciment case studies


which actually helped them to like a


better life or people calling us Teo I'm


so happy this was the best decision of


my life working with you together I was


talking to my husband I can finally


sleep again that's like these moments


when you feel really appreciated and


you're feeling on on the right path yeah


and that's what brings in energy and and


also trust to go on and on yeah that's


it I think you have to take it like one


step at a time right like for me first


just putting my face on social media was


awkward and then posting a video still


awkward and then you just you break


through these barriers I know you said


you were starting YouTube soon too today


I know yeah I think I talk guys but


actually it's it's my first YouTube


video dropping and I had a little head


start because for this year I started


out with the short form content so I've


been pushing reals on on X and on


Instagram and on Tik Tok for every day


last I think three to four months past


so I get used to it but it was still


hard in the beginning to see myself


talking into the camera and I can


totally understand that people who


consume this content every day or or see


those content pieces of mine every day


that some of them are really really


annoyed by it and I can totally


understand because it's sometime I think


that the timing when it's working is


when you piss off a decent amount of


people but you attract also the more


important ones yeah yeah you got to


crack a few eggs to make Om and yeah


like for me the more reach we get across


our social media the more hate we


attract I think that just confirms like


you're on the right track and you're


getting more attention from everyone so


I think as you get more sales calls from


social media or whatever marketing


channel you use you'll certainly get a


bit of hate but you got to accept that


part of the game fact is that it was


easier for me building up my homepage


and my website to get more organic leads


than putting my face in front of social


media so it was way harder for me to go


be present on social then to build out


my website that's for sure so for years


I was hiding behind my domain and then I


tried to get in front of the camera and


now the reals going like for us we're


starting to scale that too like we post


a couple of shorts on YouTube daily


about SEO but we want to scale that more


across IG across Tik Tok and it's


basically the same format yeah sure how


have you found it working for you


there's different types of contents and


I made there we always take the same um


content short form piece and put it on


all three platforms so IG Tik Tok and


and YouTube shorts and there's some


basically I think the common sens is


that the most performing ones are on Tik


Tok from reach and Impressions but also


there's some nuggets which really


perform on YouTube that don't perform on


on Tik Tok and there's this total


average of good performing ones on IG


definitely you far ahead concerning


regarding social media and Julian so I


have not enough experience but I still


think the one groundbreaking thing I am


I could niiz during this time is it


doesn't matter if it's always the best


content but it matters if you break


through by coming back every day so this


everyday this everyday exposure rehabs


break through because people I know and


and people in the industry and and


people also agency colleagues of mine


they say oh you guys are really present


or or it's really successful right so I


think just because you're there every


day you're really successful so I think


being there every day really helps to


show what you're doing yeah what we've s


what we found with YouTube or just short


content in general when it comes to


short form video content we found the


for example with IG it is a momentum


game where we might started off 100 a


day 100 views or Impressions a day and


now we're getting up to 4,300 a day and


it's like gradually just growing nicely


and the other thing that we've seen is


like three different options I think


right now so number one is you can


create a customade video for short form


format you record in portrait mode and


looks really nice the other option is


you can take an existing video and then


you can edit it down you get a proper


Editor to do it all for you that's


currently what we're trying to do the


other option is like AI where you get


like Opus Clips or something like that


out of all of those I found the Opus


clips and AI short form video generators


pretty trash like they don't really get


us many good results and then the ones


that perform best is where I've just


recorded like custom made but it


requires a lot of your time and energy


but I think the best and most scalable


middle ground that we found for short


fun video content across all platforms


across IG Tik Tok everything that


performs the best is usually when we've


got a really good video editor that


would train for a long time and they


just perfect the the video itself and


that's working really well for us so


we're going to try and scale that in a


minute oh are you also cutting down the


long form content into like short form


content pieces are you recording the


short form stuff separately yes so I


used to record the short form content


myself separately but again it requires


like editing scripting a lot of like


work for me it's not that scalable and


so now what we do is we we'll take one


long form video I actually made a video


about see day on a live stream we'll


take one for long form video and we'll


chop it up into 100 different custom


made pieces of content including shorts


and that seems to work really well


because we can just get an amazing


editor we'll train them up we'll coach


him every single day and then yeah they


do really well on that nice that's


working well so where are you up to like


in your agency when it comes to mm like


obviously you started a few years ago


you look like quite a young lad as well


I don't know how old you are but 35 yeah


exactly what's the secret what's the


secret good to stay to stay good-looking


at 35 do you mean well I would say ice


baths for me personally I think it's the


ice yeah in Munich there's in river


called isar and which comes from the


mountains is really cold and I switched


my apartment so right now I'm living


next to with my girlfriend so every


morning I jump in there it's it's


getting icier and icier it's not like


your ice bath I see on your socials but


it's still it's just something and then


in Winter it gets really chilly I'm


rolling every day to get my S because of


the winter to be honest I'm not the


biggest ice bath guy but I like to Chum


in there once in a while I guess the


secret to come back to your questions


this I think that the biggest mind


changing stuff I experienced this year


is to really to really have a team is


what brings in new energy and also


motivation and to be a good employer


actually that's what brought me back


like the sense of why I'm doing what I'm


doing because for years and years I I


had like the idea of staying this oneman


gang or two men gang together with my


brother and and we didn't think that


employees might make it more serious or


less flexible but it's the exact


opposite so what really helped me and


what's going on in the agency this year


we increased to 13 to 13 people in the


agency and for the first time I feel we


have the right amount of people and the


right amount of setting to fill in all


the roles coming from link building to


content to backend stuff stuff also


going into sales and just brings in ease


and also calms me down because I know


I'm not responsible for everything


that's what was changing yeah I would


agree with that I think like when you


start off doing SEO you're like a lone


wall and then you take that mindset into


your agency as well at first I see a lot


of agencies who they don't want really


want to hire it was one guy I met he he


was on the YouTube channel I won't say


his name but this guy was working like


16 hour days every day but but himself


and everything that he was doing he


could have got someone else to do but he


just didn't want to do it and so he was


making his life chaos but I think that


Lo Lone Wolf mindset is super lonely and


you just got to let it go and the sooner


you can start learning how to lead the


better like for me personally we found


that we don't necessarily need like 5 to


10 x amount of people but we do need to


like 5 to 10x the amount we get out of


our people and just coach them train


them every single day for example like


account managers and the sales team we


just training them every single day


trying to make them better and better


measuring yeah yeah because I think as a


CEO of an agency particularly an SEO the


more you can get out of your people and


the more time you spend with them like


everything else gets easier yeah yeah


how many people are you right now at


goie agency are surrounding yourself


yeah so across the whole agency we have


50 people 50 people and they all work on


remotely probably yeah yeah they all


work remotely


but then I personally manag five okay


hey when did you start with the whole


SEO thing and then what was the time


when you really exploded in traffic and


visibility because if I'm thinking back


three or four years I haven't heard of a


Julian goalie just wasn't I don't know


tell me again to really hear personally


from you when did you break through do


you mean in terms of like the ages yeah


in terms of like agency YouTube all that


stuff yeah I was always the SEO that


nobody knew


so I would go to masterminds like even


up to 2022 I would go to masterminds I


would sit next to people who I speak to


all the time now but back then we didn't


know each other and we'd sit around this


table and I'd be like we're up to this


MMR in the agency we want to get to this


MMR Etc and they'd be like mate how are


you at that level and I've never met or


heard of you before and everyone was


like that and and so this is going to


sound brutal but we had a marketing team


so we had a marketing manager ads


manager we had a video script writer


video editor Etc Big Marketing and it


was at that point I realized there was


something terribly wrong with the setup


of the the marketing team and so that


was 2022 probably November December by


January and this listen they were all


great people but I had to have a big


clear out we wiped out the whole


marketing team started from scratch


again and I just started publishing


videos every day I remember one video


it went from normally I would get like


200 300 views a video early


2023 remember one video got to 10K in 24


hours I was like wow what happened here


crazy I've never seen that before but


the dopamine Rush was great and so at


that point I was like I'm just going to


do this every single day and if I get


like a thousand views I'm happy with


that like even today if I get up to a


th000 views video it's totally fine with


me we'll get more views out B later


anyway and so that was pretty much it


like probably when I started showing


chat gbt like February last year yeah


that's when I broke through yeah and it


was all coming from Yi yeah that's crazy


I think that's the time when when you


really came on my map of seeing yourself


I think that's when we also reached out


to you I think Anna also reached out


because at this time I think I made a I


locked in to the portal to SP I think I


I ordered one of the links of yours and


then I reached out and she told me to


why don't you work with us directly


together and that's also when she told


me about the Mastermind in in school and


your your online


course that's that's I think that's


pretty much the time when we enrolled a


year ago and when we also started link


building with you guys yeah how are you


finding that the SEO Elite Circle the


SEO boardroom ah it's it's great as good


as I have time consuming it so a lot of


some weeks I just don't find time


because right now it was a lot about um


new leads and new clients and and new


employees but still it's I feel really


comfortable in there I don't feel


anybody's holding back because I've been


to courses I've been to masterminds


where they're holding back information


crucial information I think it's super


important to be transparent to share


everything and that's what I really


appreciate and I like talking to other


guys and everybody's really open so I


did uh take away some really good gold


nuggets for me as an O as as an SEO


who's been doing this for years and


years it's not always about getting new


information for me it's also about re


reassure myself that there's no new


information you know that's what I like


consuming about SEO okay and and if


there's tiny little piece of new


information it'll help a lot definitely


yeah then I try teaching it to the rest


of the team and so like in the time


you've been running an agency where are


you up to now with your MMR at what s


level yeah so we I can tell you like


development of the last two years I


think for a long time we've trying to


solve we've been trying to solve sales


problems with more marketing until I


finally understood that you solve the


sales problems with more sales and this


was like a groundbreaking moment because


during this time we we doubled in in in


monthly Revenue congrats and I have to


talk to my colleague because I'm not


100% into it but I think it's like a


120k a month right now very nice man


congrats congrats on the success it's


awesome yeah and then we've been we've


been bouncing a little up and down on


this level for the last last 12 24


months but I'm still I have the the got


feeling that right now we we are on on a


base with a team and with the revenue


and with the client base and also the


Fulfillment processes that we can easily


hold this and increase but with no rush


okay the most important thing for me is


to have those line results as um number


one prior yeah 100% that's the other


thing isn't it is you scale like we


found this particularly when we got to


like 100k month was at that point you


start to see problems with ch rate and


retention and then that's a whole


different like ball game you have to to


start learning again and it's fun to


learn but it's something most agencies


of sort of the six figure level won't


really think about


yeah what sort of stuff are you doing


for sales then to to you were talking


about solving the sales problem trying


to increase that what sort of systems


have you set up for that okay so in


Germany we've been to different sales


coachings from leading agencies and they


teach us to to Really qualify more what


leads you're talking to so we're trying


to ask the question of if they're


they're ready to invest this X or why


amount of money because this eliminated


the time talking to people that are not


qualified to work with us so that was a


big game changer and then we implemented


also like this two-step sales process


where we have the first qualification


call where we setting the people then we


have the second strategy call where we


selling them actually something but


packed into lots of fre strategy which


they didn't can take either way and then


we increased the time frame of the the


contract time and we filled in some


setup fee to only work with the


companies that are ready to take action


and responsibility and eliminate all the


energy sucking ones that's pretty much


what happened that's how we optimize the


sales process and then second of all we


got more visible because we I think


right now we on Google on on HRA we have


a 3 or 400k traffic then we also


internationalized our uh


website this is one crazy tool I think


you probably heard of it it's called


vload the translation tool where you can


internationalize your


website vload yeah it's w g l t so we


also implemented this I think we have


like 10 10 10 languages right now on the


website we're also generating leads from


overseas and the Willing building also


for foreign countries and yeah and then


also we came into the social media game


game I think after 35 years I finally


understood what's social media about and


then we retarget all the traffic into


Google demand gen and YouTube


remarketing and we also started to send


a filming videography team to our


clients and then they recorded


testimonials at the client space which


we upload on YouTube yeah and I think


that's the best proof you can get if


somebody else talks about how they got


successful


with yourself


yeah yeah I would agree with that think


sometimes in SEO it can be challenging


to get a referral out of your clients


but if you get a video testimonial that


solves a problem because when people


come to your website or your funnels


it's basically a referral isn't it it's


basically them saying yeah it's trust


which is awesome there's some really


good points there I've never really


considered hiring a videography team and


sending them out to clients that's a


really cool idea I like it yeah and


that's what also we hear in sales calls


that people are referring to the YouTube


testimony videos and talking about yeah


I've seen this I've seen that this is my


case oh yeah this feels like my case so


they feel they're being in the right


place right


now yeah that's awesome one of the


things that we recommend some of the


agencies in our SE circle is if they


don't have clients yet they can start


interviewing potential clients or people


in their industry who have been


successful and then number one it


creates content to Market their SEO


agency but number two it already opens


the door to having a conversation with a


potential client I think video is just


so powerful for that I mean that's what


we're do actually right now I'm I'm in


your YouTube and that's why I'm starting


with YouTube videos to get just more


trust and in the end if you have the


YouTube video content you can syndicated


on so many platforms you can make it


into written content you have audio


that's the f


yeah that's what I love cuz particularly


with AI I think something that wasn't


Bible 12 months ago which you can do now


is you can take that piece of content


and you could always Syndicate it right


like you could always back in the day


Syndicate it but the quality was never


that good whereas now I see for example


if we take a a video and we plug that


into a tweet it's better than any human


could do and it's faster and it gets


like crazy engagement and so I think the


potential now if you understand like you


obviously do and also if you're creating


content like you are the potential to


just expand that reach exponentially is


better than ever it's better than ever


it's been before it just takes some time


to to not fill this space with the


Fulfillment or other other


responsibilities and and right now


finally me and my brother kristofh for


running the agency we have time to get


personally more into marketing and sales


which then creates new new possibilities


with YouTube because before I've always


wanted to do it for years but it just


haven't had the


title yeah yeah I always find like with


running the agency is like you just work


at you work on that main constraint that


limits you now and quite often when


you're starting off and you're getting


more clients it's like operations is


limiting you and then it's sales and


having a good sales team and then what I


found was that marketing was like the


last piece of the puzzle to solve most


of the problems that we had and so you


just work on that constraint and I would


say for me personally we tend to spend


like 100 minutes a day for 100 days


until that constraint is solved and then


we're good to go the 50 people you've


been talking about how many of them are


marketing


three okay who also are super confident


with any I tool you've been teaching


them and showing them I would say out of


all of out of those three people one of


them is exceptional with AI and it's


just


because every single day we have this


feedback tracker together and it's


number one make your projections mate so


number one say how many Impressions on


Twitter say you want to get today versus


how many do you actually get and what's


the difference how can you measure the


inputs and output so that's the first


thing that we trained him with and then


also everything that I've learned with


AI I've passed on to him so all the


systems all the tools and everything


like and then yeah we just critique each


day it's like a positive feedback loop


this very quick so he's what I think he


did great today one two 3 here's what I


think you can improve today one two


three and we just repeat that every 24


hours and so every 24 hours he becomes


exponentially better yeah that's crazy


we've got a lot of to learn from your


social media marketing also email copy


really impressed what what you doing


like fun is so one proove and there's no


way to out actually for me yeah in a


really comfortable way like it's


annoying me it's always bringing in new


value and I feel yeah he's right with


this point he's right with that point so


the


argumentation and how you picture things


are always for me although I know


basically all the St it's always a no


bre to get into action and then so why


we started working with you because why


not in or Capac with a well drained and


then one experienc in building agency


thanks F yeah I appreciate that I think


for us like two of our core Val users


number one speed is king So just moveing


really fast like those feedback loops we


were talking about every 24 hours


instead of every week all of a sudden we


can move way faster than anyone else and


then also leading with value so number


one like even whether it's my YouTube


videos whether it's my team's follow-up


emails whether it's emails we send to


the funnel everything's like his value


90% and then by the way if you do want


to buy from us here's a link to do that


yeah yeah there what ROM from you that


you point our Discord and she so clearly


every time every called tiny content


piece that's always to get in contact


with you guys yeah yeah yeah EXA ex it


was great catching up mate it was really


good last question if you had to start


off with the social media again what


would be the one platform you'd be


focusing on 100% if you'd only had one


was YouTube or Instagram or if you had


to start a fresh what would it be if I


over again I would pump out one one


video every single day for 100 days


spend the first four hours of my day


just 100% focused on that and then I


would just showcase what I'm doing I'd


be like hey guys I learned this about AI


today here's what I learn tomorrow ET


his prompts and then also I would keep


this is one thing that I really regret


not doing is documenting the process so


now for example every single day when


I'm working on YouTube I'll come up with


three to five things that I need to


improve or I learned so that I don't


keep making the the same mistakes again


and if I had done that four years ago


and not started doing that last year the


results would have been 10 times faster


and 10 times better and yeah I think if


I started from scratch feedback tracker


marking my improvements record every


single day and spend the first four


hours of my day on YouTube doing I was


hoping it say YouTube so it feels like


I'm on the right track yeah it's wide


open man if you look at someone for


example like Kardash also followed our


course that's inside the SE Elite Circle


for YouTube in fact the second part of


it is him and me like speaking together


and he grew his YouTube channel from


like zero I think back in November and


now it's grown to 30,000 35,000


YouTubers YouTube subscribers so that's


yeah and it's awesome to see people


succeed like that I think there's so


much room for all of us to grow and to


reach a lot of people and we're all


doing different things too so massive


amount of abundance here by thanks
