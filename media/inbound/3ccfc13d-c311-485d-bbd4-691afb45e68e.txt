Google just dropped anti-gravity and


it's insane. This thing builds entire


apps while you watch. No coding needed.


Just tell it what you want and AI agents


do everything. I'm talking landing


pages, automation tools, full websites


in minutes. This is the future and I'm


showing you everything. And listen, what


I'm about to show you is probably the


most powerful AI tool that's come out


this year. And most people have no idea


it exists yet, which means you're early.


Really early. And that matters because


the people who learn this first are


going to have a massive advantage over


everyone else. Google just released


something called anti-gravity. And it's


not like chat GPT. It's not like Claude.


It's not even like the other AI coding


tools you've heard of. This is


completely different. This is Google's


secret weapon powered by their Gemini 3


models. And it doesn't just write code.


It builds entire projects autonomously.


like having a full development team


working for you around the clock. Except


it's AI agents and they don't sleep.


They don't take breaks. They just build.


I'm talking full websites, landing pages


that actually convert automation systems


that save you hours every single day.


Custom apps, tools, dashboards,


everything. And here's what makes this


absolutely insane. You don't need to


know how to code. Not even a little bit.


You just tell it what you want. in plain


English like you're talking to a person


and it builds the entire thing right in


front of you with screenshots proving it


works with tests to make sure nothing


breaks with documentation explaining


everything is like magic except it's


real and it's available right now here's


why you need to watch this entire course


because I'm not just going to show you


the basics I'm going to show you


everything the stuff nobody else is


talking about yet how to set it up


properly so it actually works how how to


use the different modes how to make the


agents work together how to build


complex projects step by step how to


troubleshoot when things go wrong, how


to optimize for speed, how to use the


advanced features that multiply your


results, and most importantly, I'm going


to build real projects with you live on


screen so you can see exactly how this


works in the real world. By the end of


this course, you're going to be able to


build things you never thought possible


without hiring anyone, without learning


to code, without spending months trying


to figure it out. You're going to have a


superpower. And in a world where AI is


moving this fast, that superpower is


going to separate you from everyone else


who's still doing things the old way,


the slow way, the expensive way. Let's


go. Hey, if we haven't met already, I'm


the digital avatar of Julian Goldie, CEO


of SEO agency Goldie Agency. Whilst he's


helping clients get more leads and


customers, I'm here to help you get the


latest AI updates. Julian Goldie reads


every comment, so make sure you comment


below. So today, I'm going to show you


how to vibe code with anti-gravity. So


this is a free tool from Google that


allows you to code with for example


Claude or Gemini or all your other tools


to build apps, tools, games, websites,


pretty much anything that you can think


of. You can build anti-gravity. And so


what you can do is inside anti-gravity,


you can code out different things you


want to. So for example, this was


actually a quiz. And then you can get


the AI agent to test and code with you.


And you know, this is changing how


people build tools, websites,


dashboards, and automations. And here's


the crazy part. You don't need to know


how to code. You don't need to hire


developers. You don't need to spend


months learning technical stuff. You


just tell it what you want it plain


English. Then multiple AI agents work


together to build this stuff out for


you. So, one agent will write the code.


Another agent test it. Another agent


fixes bugs. And even take screenshots


and videos to show you what they did.


So, today I'm going to show you exactly


how it works. We're going to test it


live right here. We're going to build


some tools together you can actually use


inside your business. Things like lead


trackers, content, dashboards, client


portals, all built with AI. and I'm


going give you the exact prompts that we


use, plus a 30-day plan to go from zero


to building your own business source,


even if you've never written a single


line of code in your life. This is brand


new. We're testing it live. See what it


can do. Let's get straight into it. If


you haven't used it before, this is how


it works. If we say, for example, okay,


test this out, and this is the quiz that


we actually built out previously. We're


actually going to get the AI agent to


now test out this quiz live. And it will


just click buttons and work on testing


out this tool that it built in the


background. Right? So you can see it's


just launching, running the terminal


commands, hosting this locally, etc. And


then locating this, right? And now it's


launched the AI browser and it's going


to navigate to the project that it's


built offline. So this is the tool


that's built. This is a quiz and it's


actually going to use that quiz and


start using it directly here. Again, I'm


not touching this. I'm not messing


around with this. It's just going off


and doing everything. All right. So if


we hit confirm, so it's actually going


to start analyzing the page, start


videoing the screen, and then using this


to test it out. All right. So today,


what I'm going to show you is the Goldie


Gravity Launch Framework. And this is my


favorite and personal framework for


building business automation tools with


AI agents. Here's why it works. Most


people think building apps takes months.


They think you need developers. They


think you need to understand


programming. None of that is true


anymore, right? With Google Anraity, you


become architect, right? So you tell AI


agents what to build. They do the heavy


lifting and you just guide them and


approve their work. And this framework


has five phases. So liftoff. So days 1 7


you're going to get the tools set up and


learn the basics. Days 8 to 14 this is a


30-day plan you're going to learn how to


build first your simple tools right


phase three days 15 to 21 you create


more complex business tools. Phase 4


days 22 to 28 you test and refine and


then phase five is like scaling right so


days 29 to 30 you want to deploy and use


this inside your actual business. All


right so example let me show you how


this works. These are some real tools I


actually want for my own business. For


example, for the AR profit boardroom, I


want like a member progress dashboard,


right? A tool that shows new members


what to do first. It tracks their


progress through the community, shows


leaderboards and achievements. All


right. So, what I can do is I can go


into Antiggravity. We can open up a new


window which will open up a new project.


We'll click on open folder. We'll type


in member dashboard. We're going to


close this other one over here. And then


we're going to go back to antigravity.


Open up that folder for the dashboard as


you can see. And what you can see here


inside anti-gravity is you have over


here your project files. Over here you


have the actual code and then over here


you have the chat. Right? And this is


really where you're going to interact


with stuff inside the chat. You can


switch between planning and fast mode.


I'm going to go with fast mode and then


we're going to type this in. Right now


you want to give it a bit of context


about you, your business, etc. So I'm


going to say okay create a dashboard for


this but do it for the AI profit


boardroom community. Right? And then


what we can actually do is go to the AI


profit boardroom grab some information


about it etc. Right? So we can take this


information like so. Plug that into


anti-gravity. Here's some info about it,


right? And it can be messy inside the


prompt. It doesn't really matter. And


then what we're going to do is say,


okay, build this. Then we're going to


hit enter. And what this will do is


start figuring out, okay, what are the


dashboard elements? How do we integrate


the gamification of it? How do we begin


the project setup? Right? And it's going


to run some terminal commands. But if


you've got your settings enabled so that


it runs terminal commands for you


without you approving them, you're going


to save a lot of time. So you can see


here inside the settings of the agent we


have for example like terminal command


auto we have allow terminal commands etc


right and that just saves a lot of time


and then you know that will just


automate a lot of the prompting that


sort of thing if you're not sure about


this stuff you don't have to allow it


it's just this saves me time and that's


what I'm going to allow and the same for


the browser agent as well we've got a


bunch of approved websites we've got the


settings for it over here and then we're


just going to X off that and you can see


that's now beginning to build this out


right so it's actually created did


images with Nana Banana Pro and then


it's going to build out the HTML for our


project so that we can test it out. By


the way, source sporters, you're asking


about like how to start your social


media from scratch, right? So, what I'd


recommend is if you go to the AI prof


here and then you go to the YouTube AI


road map, it will show you how to build


a YouTube channel from scratch based on


what's worked for me, right? Also, if


you want to learn how to, for example,


automate your X account from scratch,


you can get that inside this section.


And the same for like shorts and all our


other social media channels. We show you


exactly how to automate all of that


stuff using the board teachings in the


classroom inside there. So that's the


best place to learn that stuff. So we


can see that's now beginning to build


out the dashboard here. And now we've


got a dashboard as we requested. Right


now this is going to test out first


check it's okay etc. But you can see how


easy that was to build. Right. And we've


generated the dashboard here. We can


actually stop this. So we can stop the


agent, force it to close, etc. And then


we can switch between the pages and that


sort of thing. All right. So let's close


that now. Have a look through. Yeah. All


right. So, it's built out the dashboard.


Like, so that's how you can build out a


really quick dashboard. Again, some of


those pages didn't work. So, you just


want to make sure you continue to code


out or the AI agent will test it and


continue to code out. But that's


basically how it works, right? You could


also, for example, create a live caller.


All right. So, we could take that. We


can go to anti-gravity and we can say,


okay, delete everything, but now create


a live calluler for the AR profit order.


All right. We'll stop the agent over


here and we just tell it to start again


and build this cool schedule for her.


Right now, I wouldn't recommend starting


again, but it's just because I'm showing


this live for you and I want to


demonstrate like how easy it is to vibe


code stuff out. Right. You can also, for


example, take screenshots and then


upload them inside the chat here. So, if


you click on plus, you can add images,


you can do mentions, you can actually


mention workflows as well, which is


pretty cool. So, if you go to workflows


here, you can set up workflows. And then


you can see it's now beginning to code


out the new version of the tool that we


were building out. So, I've actually got


a 30-day Goldie gravity launcher plan,


right? And this shows you exactly what


to do each day, every day as a tool to


use in a prompt to try, right? So, for


example, like in the liftoff phase, days


one to seven, the setup and the basics.


I've broken down exactly what to do


every single day if you really want to


master anti-gravity. This is inside the


AI success lab, and it's completely


free, but you can get like a 30-day plan


on exactly how to implement this stuff


for you. So, it will show you how to,


for example, like test out Gemini Pro


and by the way, this is the newly coded


live calluler. So this is the AI agent


testing it out now and you can see that


it's clicking through the pages seeing


what to do etc. It's actually built in


some ways that we could sync Google and


everything else and you can sync it to


your calendar now and then it also has a


link to the Zoom room. Now that calendar


itself looks really nice right like the


design itself looks super nice. It's


built into the actual dashboard we


created before and you can see it's now


beginning to schedule in the tools and


everything else right if you ever want


to take over the AI you can. But you can


see here for example it's got these are


the upcoming calls this week right and


then it's got the sync options plus we


can download the calendar and we've just


live coded a calendar app in the space


of 2 minutes whilst I've been talking to


you right and you can also for example


enable email reminders or browser


notifications etc inside this it's got a


live soon section which looks super nice


and the whole looks great right and that


was coded out using Google Gemini flash


now you can switch between these so you


could use for example like quartic 4.5


opus you could use Gemini three three


pro low and high. But actually to be


honest, like Gemini Flash is great


because it's fast. It doesn't seem to


hit the limit so much and it's super


quick to use and build out. But you can


see how powerful this is. You can vibe


code almost anything that you can think


of and the only limitation is really


your creativity or figuring out like the


best business cases to use it. So this


is the 30-day plan. What I've actually


done as well is inside the notes from


today, I've added 100 different prompts


for solarreneurs. So these are like


prompts you can copy and paste directly


into tactic gravity and they customize


your business. So you can see all these


lead generation tools that you could


build, client management tools, etc.


Content management tools, you got


productivity tools, right? All this


cooler stuff, right? So for example,


here we can say, okay, build a to-do


list app with add complete and delete


functions, sort by priority. Right? So


we could go back to anti-gravity. Now we


can open up a new window means a new


folder and a new project. And we'll type


in to-do list tab. Right? We'll hit


open. So we're going to X off the old


project. We're going to go into the new


project. We can actually switch into


planning first, which will create better


outputs, right? So, if you use a


planning function instead, you will get


better outputs. It's going to start


planning the to-do list for the to-do


list app, which we'll come back to in a


second. But, yeah, it's pretty amazing


what you can do here. Now, what I want


to show you is I want to share some


truths that might surprise you. So, some


people say that building apps takes


months of coding. The right belief


instead is that AI agents build apps in


minutes, right? So, for example, Thomas


Edison, he tried over a thousand times


to make the light bulb work. in each try


took weeks or months of careful work.


Today we flip a switch and we have a


light instantly. And the same shift is


happening with building tools, right?


What used to take a team of developers


months now takes one person with the


right prompts minutes. And Edison didn't


give up because the technology kept


improving. You shouldn't give up on


building tools because the technology


has finally arrived. Google Anti-gravity


is basically the light switch moment for


app building. Some people say I'm not


technical enough. This is the to-do list


app, by the way, that's just opened in


the background. Right? You just need to


describe what you want. So for example,


like Richard Branson, he always


struggled with reading and writing his


whole life, but he built hundreds of


companies. And he didn't do it by being


the smartest person in the room. He did


it by describing his vision clearly to


others who could execute. Google gravity


works the same way. So you don't need to


understand code. You need to describe


what you want clearly. The AI agents are


your technical team. Your job is to be


the visionary. For example, Branson


would love this technology, right? He's


a visionary. Other people will say AI


tools are just hype. The right belief


here is that a fundamental shift in how


things are getting built has changed


with anti-gravity. If you look at Walt


Disney for example, he was told no by


everyone. And they all said his dream of


a theme park was a fantasy. It would


never work. But Disney saw something


they couldn't see. He saw a future where


families would pay to experience magic.


And AI tools today face similar doubt.


Some people say it's just autocomplete.


Some people say it can't do real work


and some people say it will never


replace developers. But the people using


these tools right now, they're building


businesses faster than before. They're


creating tools that competitors can't


even imagine. And Disney didn't let


doubt stop him. So don't let doubt stop


you from exploring what's possible. So


if we go back to the tool now, we've got


the to-do list. So let's test this out.


Okay. So we're going to say check out


anti-gravity. As a to-do list, we'll


select high priority and low. Hit add


task. Boom. Does it work? Yes. Does it


look nice? Yes. Did it work first time


around? Yes. Did we code it for free


with anti-gravity? Yes, my friends. All


right, and we've done the same with all


of these tools and apps that we built


today. All right, so you can create


amazing stuff with this. You can create


magic with this if you know what you're


doing. So, thanks so much for watching.


If you want to get all the video notes


from today, that is exactly how to vibe


code with anti-gravity. You can


basically vibe code anything you want.


And inside the AI success lab, which


comes with a community of 40,000


members, it's completely free. You can


post in the community. You can connect


with 40,000 people inside the classroom


here, you will get access to all this


cool stuff. And if you go inside the


December section here, you can see all


the notes from today with the prompts,


the tools, the tips, the framework.


Right? So, this is the Goldie Gravity


launch framework. You've got, for


example, the build ideas that we


actually built. You've got all the


prompts from today as well. And you have


the 30-day road map plus all the beliefs


that we've talked about as well, right?


So, it's basically a full guide, a full


very in-depth guide on exactly how to


use anti-gravity. It talks about the


wrong beliefs, the right beliefs, and


how to overcome them, right? To get


results with this stuff. Now, if you're


wondering, okay, do people actually get


results? that people actually build


stuff with this. You can actually check


out the air profit boardroom and we have


over 108 pages of fromos inside the air


profit boardroom. All right, so for


example, Elsa, she said, "Wow, this


community is next level." Right? Mike


said, "Julian, your content is amazing."


Right? Eric said, "Programmed a


WordPress plugin with Manis." Steven


said he'd never heard of NM before and


now we built something that actually


saved him 10% of his time. Right? It's


freed up 10% of his time using the


automations from the AirPod. Andrew got


his first win by creating his first AI


avatar video. You've got Omelle said


like how good the week one lesson is for


AI agents and there's so many people


getting results with this stuff. Darren


as well, he said, "Wow, that's so


exciting." It's a credit for you to all


your wonderful training support. It's a


credit to this community who share.


Congratulations. And so we got 108 pages


of stuff like this, all these different


testimonials. As you can see, it's


pretty much an endless scroll at this


point. I don't think I've even had the


chance to read them all. But the main


thing to note here is if you want to


join a community of winners, if you want


to see what people are building with


this stuff, if you want to connect with


some of the best AI automators in the


world, join the AI profit board because


inside the community you get the


accountability group, you can post, you


can ask questions, you can share your


wins, you can share your goals, you can


read the value post, you can get the


weekly updates, right? And also inside


the classroom here, you get all of my


best trainings on AI automation. So, for


example, we show you how to get results


with AI and go from beginner to expert


in just 6 weeks, right? and we show you


how to build your first air agent in


under five minutes. On top of that, we


show you our playbook, right? And this


is our playbook for automating Twitter


newsletters, shorts, AI avatar videos,


screen shares, automating videos with


AI, etc. Right? We have training on, for


example, lead generation, social media,


NA10 templates, agency courses. We've


got stuff on how to get clients, AI


automation, YouTube, etc. All this cool


stuff. And then also if you need help in


real time, you want to jump on a call


with someone, you can actually jump on


four weekly coaching calls as you can


see right here. So you can jump on these


coaching calls, get help, support


whenever you need it and get your


questions answered in real time. And if


you can't make the coaching calls, no


problem at all. You can watch them back


inside the call recording section here.


So amazing community. Feel free to check


that out. That is at the AI profit board


link in the description or you can go to


a profitboarding.com. Google just


dropped something wild. It's called


anti-gravity. And when you combine it


with clawed code is like having an


entire dev team working for you. I'm


talking planning, coding, testing, all


done by AI agents while you watch. This


is the craziest AI coding combo I've


seen. And I'm about to show you exactly


how it works. Let's dive in. All right,


so here's what's happening right now in


the AI coding world. Google just


launched something called Anti-Gravity


on November 18th, 2025. It's not just


another code editor. is a full AI agent


IDE that uses their new Gemini 3 Pro


model to actually plan, execute, and


validate code for you. Think of it like


this. Instead of you writing every line


of code, you have AI agents that work


semi-autonomously across your entire


project. They can access your editor,


your terminal, even an integrated


browser. And here's where it gets


insane. When you combine anti-gravity


with Claude Code, which runs on


Anthropics Claude Opus 4.5, you get the


best of both worlds. Gemini handles the


planning and orchestration. Claude


handles the actual code execution and


generation. It's like having a project


manager and a senior developer working


together except they're both AI.


Anti-gravity is Google's new agent first


IDE. Instead of just giving code


suggestions, it runs autonomous agents


that complete entire tasks. These agents


create task lists, take screenshots, and


work while you do other things. It


supports Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.


Claude Code is Anthropic's coding


environment you access through your


terminal. It generates code, debugs


problems, and creates entire project


structures. The latest version runs on


Claude Opus 4.5, and it's incredibly


good at coding tasks. Why combine them?


Because each one covers the other's


weaknesses. Anti-gravity is amazing at


planning and coordinating. Clawed Code


is better at actually writing complex


code with fewer bugs. The hybrid


workflow use Gemini for planning, Claude


Code for execution, anti-gravity for


testing. Let me show you what this looks


like in practice. Let's say I want to


build a new landing page for the AI


profit boardroom. I want it to convert


visitors, show the amazing value of AI


automation, and explain all the benefits


of our community to get more customers,


leads, and traffic. Here's how I'd use


this combo. First, I open anti-gravity


and give it the highle task. I tell it,


create a landing page for AI profit


boardroom that focuses on conversion,


highlights community benefits, and uses


modern design principles. Anti-gravity's


Gemini agent breaks this down into a


task list. It says create file


structure, design hero section, build


features list, add testimonial section,


create CTA buttons, set up responsive


styling, test on multiple devices.


That's the planning phase done in


seconds. Now, here's where it gets


interesting, right? For each of those


tasks, I can choose which tool executes


it. For the file structure and basic


setup, I use clawed code. I open my


terminal, run clawed code, and paste the


requirements. It creates all the HTML,


CSS, and JavaScript files. I need clean


structure, proper naming conventions,


everything organized. This happens in


about 30 seconds. Then I switch back to


anti-gravity for the visual design work.


I tell its agent to design the hero


section with specific elements. Headline


about AI automation, sub headline about


the community, background gradient, CTA


button. The agent uses Gemini to


generate the design, creates a preview,


and even takes a screenshot so I can see


it without switching windows. If I don't


like something, I tell it to adjust. The


agent iterates until it's right. For the


features section, I go back to clawed


code because I want custom JavaScript


interactions. I describe what I want. A


features grid that animates on scroll,


highlights different benefits, and links


to specific resources. Claude code


writes the entire thing, including the


animation logic and responsive


breakpoints. It even adds comments


explaining what each part does. Back to


anti-gravity for testing its browser


agent, loads the page, tests it on


different screen sizes, checks that all


links work, and validates the HTML. It


creates a report showing what works and


what needs fixing. I can see screenshots


of every test. This is where


anti-gravity really shines because it


automates all the tedious testing work.


Now, let me tell you the benefits people


are seeing. First, you extend your usage


limits by switching between tools


strategically. You get more done before


hitting walls. Second, reliability goes


up. Clawed code produces fewer bugs and


cleaner code. Third, it feels like


having a whole dev team. One tool plans,


one codes, one tests. Token limits are


another thing. Both tools use tokens for


their AI models. Complex projects burn


through tokens fast. You need to be


strategic about what you ask each tool


to do. Don't ask for explanations you


don't need. Don't regenerate code that


already works. Be efficient with your


prompts. Model inconsistency happens


sometimes. Gemini might suggest one


approach and Claude might implement it


differently. Usually, this isn't a


problem, but occasionally you get


friction. The way to handle this is to


be very specific in your prompts. Tell


Clar code exactly what anti-gravity


planned. Don't leave room for


interpretation. Here's what I recommend


for your workflow. Use anti-gravity for


planning and project management. Let it


break down your tasks. Create timelines.


Organize your work. Use clawed code for


actual code generation, especially


complex logic or algorithms. Use


anti-gravity's agents for testing,


validation, and documentation. This


division of labor maximizes what each


tool is good at. You can also integrate


other tools into this workflow. There


are MCP servers that add extra


capabilities. For example, test sprite


MCP helps with automated testing.


Sonotype MCP helps with dependency


security. You plug these into


anti-gravity and suddenly your AI dev


stack has even more power. Now, is this


the future of coding? I think it's a big


step in that direction. We're moving


from AI that suggests code to AI that


actually builds complete features. The


role of the developer is shifting.


You're becoming more of a director and


less of a typist. You define what you


want. You orchestrate the tools. You


validate the output. The AI does the


implementation work. This matters


because it changes what's possible.


Projects that used to take weeks can now


take days. Features that used to require


a whole team can be built by one person


with the right AI tools. The barrier to


building software is dropping fast.


Here's what you should do next. If


you're a developer, try this combo. Set


up anti-gravity. Get access to clawed


code and build something real. Don't


just test it with toy projects. Build an


actual tool or feature you need. That's


when you'll see the real power. Pay


attention to which tool you use for what


tasks. Develop your own workflow


patterns. Share what you learned with


the community because this is all so new


that best practices are still emerging.


If you're not a developer, but you run a


business, understand that this


technology is going to change how fast


and cheap it is to build software. Your


competitors might already be using tools


like this to ship features faster. You


need to either adopt these tools or hire


people who know how to use them. And


here's something cool. You don't need to


be an expert coder to use this


effectively. If you understand what you


want to build and can describe it


clearly, these AI tools can handle a lot


of the technical complexity that making


software development more accessible.


Before we wrap up, I want to mention two


things that can help you even more with


AI automation. First, if you want to


learn how to save time and automate your


business with AI tools like anti-gravity


and clawed code, check out the AI profit


boardroom. We dive deep into practical


AI automation that actually works for


real businesses. You'll see exactly how


to implement these tools to get more


customers, leads, and traffic. And if


you want the full process, SLPs, and


over a 100 AI use cases like this one,


join the AI Success Lab. It's our free


AI community. Links are in the comments


and description. You'll get all the


video notes from there, plus access to


our community of 40,000 members who are


crushing it with AI. Real people, real


results, real help. Today, I'm going to


be running through exactly how to use


Google Antigravity. If you've never used


anti-gravity, basically it's a free way


to code with Google and you can also get


access to Claude as well. And it's


completely free. You can code locally


with this. You can build some amazing


stuff with this. And you can download it


at anti-gravity.goole.


Once you're in, you're going to be able


to build stuff like this as you can see.


And I'll show you, for example, how to


use this to build apps, tools, websites,


landing pages, almost anything that you


want and how to master it. It's very


easy because literally you just type in


same simple English exactly what you


want and you can get started straight


away. And today, what you're going to


learn is how to set up anti-gravity from


scratch, how to build your first app


with one sentence, how to use


screenshots to make changes, how to


watch your app get built in real time,


the exact settings you need to switch


on. And yes, this is free right now cuz


it's in public preview. All right, so


we're going to test out today. We're


going to use the anti-gravity


acceleration system. And this is my


simple framework for turning Google


Antigravity into a customer getting


machine for your business, right? And


most people would download this tool and


make a calculator, an app, or a to-do


list. And that's fun, but it's not going


to help you so much, right? with lead


generation, that sort of thing. If


instead you could build like a lead


capture landing page for your website or


a quiz that qualifies potential


customers or a tool that shows off your


expertise or a dashboard that makes you


look professional, that's what separates


those who tinker with those who build


real businesses. All right, so let me


talk you through exactly how we're going


to use this. Right, first thing you want


to do is just download this from


anti-gravity. All the links and notes


from today are inside the AI success lab


link in the comments description.


Completely free community as you can see


right here with 40,700 members. And if


you go inside the classroom here, you go


to December 2025. And then from here,


you can see that we've got all the video


notes from today. And we're going to


work through this 30-day anti-gravity


mastery plan, as you can see. And we'll


just run through exactly how to use it.


So, first thing you're going to do is


download the version. Open up like you


can see I've done over here and we're


going to get straight into this. So,


understand the two views here, right?


So, you got two views. So, you got over


here you got the builder and you can


switch between planning and fast mode.


So you can choose your AI agents and


then over here you can choose the actual


API that you're using to build and code


with. Right? Now sometimes if you're


using the free version you're going to


hit limits. So how do you overcome


those? You can switch between different


APIs. So if you hit the limits on one


you switch to the next. If you want to


plan out your project before you build


it you select planning. If you want to


build out the project and actually code


you have to select fast over here and


then you just type in what you want in


this section. Now on the left hand side


you will see the project files as you


can see. And that's basically how it


works. All right. So what we're going to


do over here is we are going to just


start with something simple. So we're


going to say okay create a simple


landing page with headline three


benefits the email signup form. Right?


So copy this and all the instructions


are inside this section. So this is for


building your first real project. Now


first thing you want to do is load up a


new folder. Okay? So open up the folder


as you can see and you just want to load


up a new folder. Right? The reason for


that is cuz you're starting a new


project from scratch like you can see.


Now, what we're going to do is we're


going to type in create a simple landing


page with a headline three benefits


email signup form. This is going to be a


really simple fast project. As you can


see, we're going to select Gemini Flash.


This will help you code out your first


landing page with anti-gravity if you're


just learning how to use this. By the


way, I can see some people in the chat


are asking for the link to the air


profit boarding. If you just type in air


profit boarding on chat GPT or Google or


you go to the air profitboarding.com,


you can get the link for it there. If


you watch it on YouTube, you can


actually get access. I saw someone else


as well is asking how to watch this


back. So if you want to watch back the


full live stream, you can get it inside


the live section of my YouTube channel.


So you can see live stream right there.


And then someone else was asking like


how to build for example uh personal


tutor and I'll come on to that in a


minute. Right. So what you can see here


is that the AI is now open up the


landing page. I'm not touching this AI


agent, right? And it's beginning to


check out the landing page, the optin


form, etc. Now this is very basic. The


design and everything else super basic,


but that's the whole point, right? We're


just trying to create something really


simple and easy to use. So if we go back


here, you can see it's now checking out,


testing out, etc. Right? And I'm going


to stop it there, right? Just to show


you how easy and simple that is. Now,


let's say, for example, you wanted to


create a personal tutor. Maybe you


wanted to create a personal tutor for


something like learning, I don't know,


learning Thai, right? What we can do


here is we can open up a new folder. All


right. So, we'll open up a folder here


and say personal tutor for Spanish,


right? We'll open that up as you can


see. And then from here we can say,


okay, build a personal tutor tool for


learning Spanish, right? I'll go with


Spanish cuz it's probably easier for the


AI to teach Spanish to the type, right?


And basically what it's going to do is


start building out this app. As you can


see, now again, if you were trying to


spend a bit more time and care over


this, then you would use the planning


mode first inside the drop down. But I


just want to go straight into fast so


we're not messing around here and we're


getting straight into it and you're


getting as much value as possible. Some


people are asking like, is this better


than other tools? Anti-gravity is really


good because you can code locally, come


back to the project, and it's free,


right? And it's also good for building


out bigger projects. So, for example, if


you're using AI Studio, you can build


out like one landing page, one mini app,


etc. But if you want to build out


something bigger than that, you can


build out bigger projects cuz you got


the files on the left hand side and


these are saved locally. I would say


that this is better for building out


bigger projects. But if you want to


create something fast and small, then


you can use something like AI Studio.


So, it depends really how big the


project is. So, this is beginning to


build out. As you can see, it's t the


CSS, the HTML, etc. It's going to test


out in a second. Whilst we're waiting


for that to load, let's come back to


this. Right. So, inside here as well,


what you can actually do is you can


change some of the settings inside


anti-gravity as well. So, if you go to


antigravity here, we go to antigravity


settings. This is the app that we built,


by the way, the Spanish app. But if we


go back to the settings inside


antigravity, you can see here we can


decide whether we want to review stuff,


where we want it in secure mode, whether


we want to auto command, etc. This will


if you auto command basically it will


never ask for confirmation before it


starts testing stuff out. So it depends.


And then also you got options for auto


continue and auto fix stuff. Right? So


if you flick those on it's just going to


automate a lot more of the process. You


can also enable web tools or disable


them depending on whether you want the


AI to be able to access the web. And


that's basically how it goes. And the


same for the browser, right? So for


example, you can check out the browser.


It can test stuff out in the browser.


And then it's got a bunch of whitelisted


pages right there as well. So let's X


off that. And we've got the tool being


tested out over here. So it says, "Ola,


I am Carlos, your Spanish teacher. How


can I help you learn today?" And then


the AI is typing in Ola and it's testing


this out, right? And then you can see at


the top here, it's beginning. I don't


think this will be fully built out, but


you've got different options at the top.


For example, the dashboard, you got the


lessons, you got the stuff to practice,


and then the tutor as well. And you can


see how the AI has actually responded to


us, right? So we put in Ola. It said,


"Hola, so how are you today? A bit of


Spanish that you learned today. At least


you learned something." The AI is


talking with the other AI, the personal


tutor, to learn Spanish, right? Some


people ask, does this access local


files? Yes. So, this is all local stuff.


So, we actually right click this, for


example, click on reveal and finder. You


can see that we've got all of these


files stored locally, and you can store


and open folders locally inside this IDE


to edit things. All right, so this is


working nicely. I say, can you teach me


Spanish? Can you say that in a full


sentence? Blah blah blah. We got the


practice section here. So, these are


like flashcards with audio, right?


Obviously, ola means hello. And we flip


it over. It's pretty nice. Like this. It


looks better than other learning apps.


I'm not going to mention which ones, but


it looks better than some of the ones.


Gracia, thank you. How are you? All


right. Like all the bill, please. Okay.


And then, mana, which is tomorrow. All


right. Flip over tomorrow. Boom. I'm too


good at Spanish. Too good, mate. Too


good. It's too easy. Once you know


Italian, you can speak Spanish pretty


fast, especially when it's as simple as


that. Then we got the classroom here for


tutoring people. We also have the


dashboard here, right? And this is all


personalized to me, right? It's not


personalized to other people. was


personalized to me cuz these are the


words I've learned and everything else,


right? And so obviously this is not 100%


ready to go. You want to test it. You


want to try it out. You want to make


sure it actually works. But have we


created a bigger like a five-page


website with flashcards, mini apps, a


tutor that speaks to us, etc.


Absolutely. Pretty amazing, right? And


so you can just keep tweaking that. It's


not going to be 100% ready to go, but it


is going to be pretty good. All right,


let's keep going through. Now once


you've done that, what you can actually


do is look at your app in the browser


preview and the AI agent will take


screenshots of it and test it out for


you. So the anti-gravity browser control


actually previews and tests it out. My


app as you saw before we deployed it,


right? So if there are any errors as the


AI agent is testing, it will actually


auto those before we find the problems


which saves a lot of time. And you can


see here the anti-gravity browser


control says the agent can click,


scroll, type and navigate web pages


automatically. Whilst working, it


displays an overlay showing it progress


in price, controls to stop if you need


to intervene, right? And then it's given


us a bunch of use cases, iterating on


website designs, quality assurance


testing, monitoring dashboards,


automating routine tasks, right? Which


is great cuz now you don't have to mess


around with like terminal commands or


anything like that. Now, what I'd


recommend from here, we've already built


a simple landing page, but now we can


build something much better, right? So,


we could actually say, okay, and these


are examples from the AI success lab.


So, all the notes are here. You say,


"Okay, build a landing page from SEO


agency. Include a headline about getting


more traffic from Google. Three bullet


points about benefits, testimonial


section, and an email signup form just


to test it out, right? We're not


actually going to launch this, but we


can test it out." And so here, I'm just


going to open up a new folder again,


test site. Let's open this up. All


right? And you can see here now we've


just got the blank files, right? And


what we're going to do is type in this


prompt as we mentioned before. And


again, that's just going to start


building it out for us, right? So it's


really beginning to build this stuff out


for us step by step. Someone asked is


new folder new project. So it's the same


project but what I've done is actually


just open a folder and replace the old


files. Right? If you wanted a new


project with a new folder, you would go


to new window here and then you can


create a new project. Right? So if you


open up a folder, this is going to


replace whatever's inside your existing


window. Everything that you code though


will be stored locally inside the folder


that you were previously editing. So now


it's beginning to code that out. As you


can see, it's pretty fast. It's actually


amazing how fast it is. And we've got


the page like so with all the


information on it and it's beginning to


coder, right? And so it's got those


testimonials. A bit more complex than


what we built before. I still prefer the


personal tutor. And now you can see the


agent needs the input. So if we click on


return to agent, we can go back to


anti-gravity. And you see here it's like


asking us to confirm something before we


test it out. All right. So if we click


on confirm, it's going to take some


screenshots of the page, right? To fix


or identify or correct any visual


issues. And there you go. All right.


Now, we're going to stop that agent, but


that's basically a simple example. And


then you can just keep making it better,


keep improving it. You might say, for


example, add more spacing, make the


headline bigger, add a subtle gradient,


make the buttons more clickable, etc.


And this back and forth is how you


really define your design. And then from


there, just build a quiz interface, for


example. And this is something else we


could do. So for example, we say create


a five question quiz that helps business


owners find out if they need help with


marketing. Each question should have


four multiple choice answers. At the


end, show a results page based on the


score. Make it look clean and


professional. So we'll go back to


anti-gravity. You know the drill. Now,


open up a new folder. Type in the quiz,


open up, and you can see we've built out


so many different projects, but we've


not hit a limit on the tokens, right?


How amazing is that? And we're using one


of the best technologies in the world


for coding this out, which is Google


Flash. One of the best tools that I've


ever used when it comes to AI. It comes


up with some pop-ups at the bottom, and


you just click okay or don't show again,


etc. And it will just start rerunning


this now. And so, we've got a full


30-day plan on all this stuff you can


build out. You can have like multiple


agents running. You can use the browser


recording, etc. But you've basically


seen how to build out three different


projects using this, right? So, quizzes,


websites, landing pages, personal


cheaters, whatever you want, whatever


websites you can build. You can do this


with anti-gravity. And this stuff looks


really cool. Check this out. This basic


landing page we built. This is the full


tutor that we built as well. So, you can


see for the SEO agency. Now, if you go


back here, it's still editing and coding


out the next project. But before we come


on to that, let me talk about what


you've done. So once you've got through


that 30-day plan that I've given you in


30 days, you just went from like zero to


building out our apps with anti-gravity.


And I would just say with your progress


just say okay based on what I've built


so far, what should I learn next to take


my skills further? Now I actually give


you a bunch of ideas and I would


recommend posting your progress inside


the AR profit boarding just so that you


can share your wins and grow with the


community because when you share stuff


and you hold yourself accountable like


our daily accountability group inside


the air profit boarding, you're going to


learn faster. You're going to get better


results. You're going to hold yourself


accountable and you're going to really


just enjoy the process as well. All


right. Now, some people going to say I'm


not technical enough for doing this and


the right belief. Oh, we've got the quiz


here. So, I'll come on to that in a


second. I'm glad it's done that. So,


also what I like about this is like when


I'm just letting it run in the


background, it will actually open up the


tab and test it when it's ready to go.


Right. So, you can see here it's


selecting the quiz. Again, I'm not


clicking anything or anything like that.


It's just messing around with the quiz,


giving us some ideas, testing it out,


and then it will actually, and you see


here, all right, we're just going to


click confirm on that. And then it's


going to test it out, right? So, it's


just testing out all the questions,


making sure the quiz works, and then it


will come on to this in a minute, right?


And so, it's built out this quiz as


well. And again, like the clean, it


looks nice, but if there are any bugs,


it's going to find them and it's going


to fix them if they're super obvious.


So, now it's reopened the quiz and if


the agent's using it cuz you can see


like the blue background. I'm actually


going to stop the agent for now cuz I


just want to explain some stuff to you.


You see that was very quick to build


out, right? So, the wrong belief is I'm


not technical enough for this. The right


belief is you just need to describe what


you want, right? So, let me tell you


about the fisherman and the smart net.


There was a fisherman who caught fish


the old way for 20 years. One day,


someone showed him a net that could find


fish on its own. I don't understand how


it works. He said, "You don't need to."


They replied, "You just tell it where


you want fish, right?" And he tried it.


First day he caught more than a whole


week of the old way, right? He never


learned how the networks. He just


learned how to use it. And Google


anti-gravity is that net. You don't need


to understand code. You just need to


know what you want. Also, some people


are going to say these free tools, they


never actually work. But the thing is,


Google actually built this with the most


advanced AI ever. Google built this, the


same Google that runs YouTube, Gmail,


and the biggest search engine in the


world. This uses Gemini 3, the most


advanced AI. And yes, it's free during


the preview. Is it perfect? No. Still


buggy places, but it works well enough


to build real apps, and it's only going


to get better. All right. Other people


will say, I've tried coding before and


failed, right? And I would say the right


belief is you failed at the old way of


coding. You didn't fail at coding. No


one failed at coding. You failed at the


old way of coding. the way where you


have to memorize syntax where one


missing comma broke everything where you


spent hours hunting for bugs. That's not


what this is. This is typing make this


look better and what should happen. This


is dragging a screenshot and saying fix


this. You've probably had conversations


with chat GBT before. Did that feel like


coding? No. Neither does this. You also


might say, I need to be a developer to


use this stuff. And that's wrong. You


just need to describe what you want.


Here's a quick test. Can you describe


what you want? If you can say, I want a


page where people enter their email and


get a free guide. If you can say that


sentence, you can use this tool. That's


the only skill required. Being able to


describe what you want and the AI


handles everything else, right? Other


people say, "This is probably just


hype." But we've tested it live right


now. We've built tools. We built landing


pages. We built forms. We built personal


tutors. We built quizzes. We've tested


it live right now. You've watched me use


it in real time. And if it didn't work,


you'd see it today. If it didn't work,


you'd know. But there were no editing or


fancy cuts in this, no pre-recorded


stuff in this. It was just raw live


testing, wasn't it? Other people would


say, "My business is different. this


won't work for me. Every business needs


the same core tools, right? So, every


business really needs a way to capture


leads, a way to show what you do, a way


to look professional, a way to answer


common questions. And every business,


every niche, every industry needs that,


right? So, whether you sell consulting


or products or services, you need these


things and this tool can build all of


them. Other people will say, well, it's


too buggy to use right now. And I would


say the bugs are part of learning early,


right? Yes, it's a bit buggy. The


browser recording feature doesn't always


work perfectly. Sometimes generations


take a while. Sometimes you need to try


a prompt a few times. But here's the


thing. Every early version of every


great tool was buggy. The people who


waited for perfect got left behind.


Don't get left behind. Some people say I


should wait until it's more stable. And


I think the best time to learn is when


it's new. Here's something interesting


about early adopters, right? They don't


for perfect. So by the time the stable


version comes out, early adopters have


already built their systems. They


already know the shortcuts. They already


have results. And the waiting crowd


starts from zero. The early are already


at the finish line, right? So let's


answer some of these questions inside


the Q&A. All right. Let's see what we


got here. Is that a onepage website or


three-page website? Is it not an app?


Because I heard you can't SEO an app.


Yeah. So, it was just a four page


website, right, with the dashboard, the


flashcards, the quizzes, and everything


else. Can it use MCP or does it need


MCP? I think you can use MCP, but I've


never tested out. I'm sure you could get


that to work. Do you need the Gemini Pro


plan for using anti-gravity? No, you


don't. You can use it for free. Today,


it's so easy to code, right? And then


Gemini, I promised it was me that failed


due to coding, which I really respect


that attitude, right? It's like I always


blame myself as well. If something


doesn't work, it's not the tools fault.


It's my fault for not being good enough,


right? And if I just get better, then


I'll be better at using these tools and


I'll get better results. So, I really


respect that, Mark. Shout out to you for


really taking accountability there. All


right, so thanks for watching. If you


want to get all the videos from today,


it's inside the AI success lab. Link in


the comments description. This connects


you with 40,700 members. As you can see,


inside the community, we have all these


awesome trainings, lots of people


introduce themselves, very active


community. You get access to the video


notes inside the December 2025 section.


So, just go down here and you can scroll


down and then get access to all this


stuff. If you want to connect with me


personally, you can join the AI profit


boardroom. Inside there, you can DM me


personally. You can connect with 1,900


AI builders. You can post inside the


community, share your wins, and get


feedback inside here because what's


great about this is you can share your


wins. You can ask questions if you ever


get stuck. You can get all this stuff


right here. All right. Mark says, "If it


fails, we learn to repair more


effectively." That's it. If it fails, I


get better at fixing stuff, right? Let's


focus on solutions, not problems. And


that's I think that's the best mindset


you can have when building with AI


automation. You can see here like loads


of people posting stuff. And then also


inside the classroom, we have four


coaching calls per week. These are live


coaching calls you can jump on. We


actually have a coaching call later


today if you want to jump on it. And


then inside the classroom here as well,


you get access to the six week AI


automation master class that shows you


how to go from like complete beginner to


really mastering AI and really learning


this stuff. Also, you'll get access to


the playbook with all of my best


automations from like how to automate


your emails, Twitter, newsletter shorts,


AI avatar videos. You probably see a lot


of my AI avatar videos popping up on


whatever social media channel you watch


me on. And then also, you'll get access


to the latest SAP updates from each


month. You'll get access to lead


generation and social media automations,


plug-andplay, the NA10 templates and


workflows, my agency course, Q&A call


recordings you can watch back from the


coaching course, the AICO automation


section, and also the YouTube AI 6E road


map. So, everything that you need to


really win with AI is inside the AR


profit boardroom. It's got an amazing I


think what really makes it just being


part of something with such great


people, right? Like the characters and


the personalities and the people that


I've connected with inside the air


profit boardroom are just absolutely


amazing. Yeah, absolutely loving it.


Casra, I was waiting for the coaching


call with Santa yesterday. Hopefully


Santa showed up, mate. I saw that you


got a banana for Christmas. That's


really Craig Campbell to get you one of


those rap bananas. Good for you, mate.


And Mark says he might have been busy.


We're about to test something that just


dropped from Google. It's called


anti-gravity. And here's why you need to


pay attention. So, this is a free tool


that builds real apps, real tools, real


systems just by typing what you want in


plain English. No code, no developers,


no tech skills needed. And I'm going to


test this live with you today. We're


going to see exactly how it works. Does


it actually deliver? Can someone with


zero coding knowledge really build


business tools in minutes? And here's


what we're going to do together. All


right, all of this using just words, no


code. And if this works the way Google


says it does, this changes everything


for entrepreneurs who want to automate


their business before they needed to


hire developers first. So, let's test


exactly how to use it. You can download


it for free right here. And then once


you've done that, you're going to see


something that looks like this. Right?


So, this is anti-gravity as you can see.


And from here, we can start building


with this. All right, if you've never


used this before, basically you've got


your files on the left hand side and


then over on the right hand side, you


can chat with the AI, right? I'm going


to be using Gemini Flash because that's


the fastest one. We can switch between


planning or fast, but I'm just going to


go straight with fast cuz I'm coding


with you in real time. And then from


here, we can start building this out.


Now, if you never used this before, let


me show you some examples of what you


can actually build with this, right? So


if we take this prompt and all these are


inside AI success lab link in the


comments description if you want to get


the video notes from today we say build


an invoice generator with PDF export


right simple as that very simple command


but basically we can build a custom app


a mini app using this process so now you


see it's beginning to code out and it's


pretty simple and easy to use this all


right so it's running the terminal


command and again this is free this is


hosting locally that's one of the other


big benefits here is you're coding


locally so number one you can store


files and you can build bigger projects


offline using this and number two you


can use it for free. And number three,


it's more private than creating that


content online because you're hosting it


locally. The only thing you got to


remember is that you're using Google's


APIs, which means that's still on


someone else's server, right? It's not


on yours. You're not using O Lama or


something like that locally to build


this. So, now it's beginning to code


this out. As you can see, creating the


directory structure, and we can come


back to that in a minute. We can


actually code out in multiple windows


here. We can use this for free up to


certain limits. And you can see here


that I can actually build a project


without hitting the limits. as you can


see inside the chat here. So, it's


beginning to code this out. It's


creating the JSON here. And I don't


code. I don't understand code. I can't


use HTML. But I can quickly build out


the tools I want just by typing in


exactly what I want. As you can see


here, so all we said was build an


invoice generator with PDF system. All


right. So, it's beginning to code that


out. Now, let me talk to you about why


this matters. All right. So, you know,


the old way of building business tools


is that you would have an idea for a


tool that would save you time. You


search for existing apps and nothing


fits perfectly. You try to learn coding


but pretty much give up after a week.


You hire a developer and wait weeks for


delivery. The tool doesn't work how you


imagined. You go back and forth with a


revision. You end up doing everything


manually anyway and you feel a bit stuck


and frustrated. That was the old way.


Now the new way if you're building with


anti-gravity is like you have an idea


for a tool. You describe it in plain


English. Anti-gravity builds it whilst


you watch. You test it immediately. You


tweak it by just saying what you want to


change. You have a working tool in


minutes. You move on to the next thing


and you feel like you have superpowers.


Right? That's exactly how this works


step by step. And so, as you can see


here, it's beginning to build this bad


boy out. And we're just going to wait


for the coding to finish. It should only


take a few minutes. It seems to be


working already. So, you see here, it's


actually hosted on a local network URL.


And let's see if we can pull this up.


Yeah. So, this is opening up the Agent


browser, but I can actually preview it


on the local host here. All right. So,


that's a URL to see it. And then you can


see we've got a working tool. Boom. We


can actually see the AI testing the tool


in real time and moving around. I'm not


touching this. I'm touching anything on


the screen. The AI is actually looking


at the screen, typing in on the left


hand side, beginning to click buttons on


my screen, and then creating this tool


and testing out so that it can improve


the tool without me even looking at it.


The cool thing about this is it can


basically prototype a tool, selfiterate,


self-improve, and then once it's finally


ready, it will give me the details to


check out. But in the meantime, it's


just going to check out if it actually


works or not. And you can see it's


adding values on the left hand side, and


then it's actually building this out on


the right hand side, and the numbers are


updating in real time. And then it's got


the download PDF feature over here.


Really cool. It's taking screenshots.


Testing the style. We can actually


change the from and the to information.


This is finished now. And you can see


that's finished on the preview with the


agent because it doesn't have the blue


lines around the edges anymore. If we go


back to anti-gravity now, we can see


that that's been tested and it's working


perfectly. Beautiful. And then if you


want to host this online, you just take


the project files, which you can see


here. So you can go to reveal and finder


and grab the folder documents, right?


Like that. And then you can host that on


Netlify and basically use that as a tool


that's hosting online and running


online, right? Pretty amazing. The only


thing that I would say that's a problem


with this and I could easily just change


this is that when we download the


document, the PDF, it downloads the


document but it doesn't save it as a


PDF, right? So that's just something to


be aware of. But everything else is


working perfectly and it's pretty


amazing what you can do with this. Now


I'm going to show you some more examples


in a minute. Some people want to say, "I


need to know how to code to build


tools." And the old story was like,


"Building apps required programming


skills, years of learning, computer


science degrees, technical knowledge


that takes forever to get." Here's the


truth. You already know how to describe


what you want. That's all you need. Now,


think about it this way. When you order


food at a restaurant, do you need to


know how to cook? No. You describe what


you want. The kitchen makes it.


Anti-gravity is a kitchen. You are the


customer. You don't need to know how the


code works. You just need to know what


you want it to do. And the new belief is


if you can describe a tool in plain


English, you can build it. Easy as that.


So just pick one simple tool you wish


existed for your business. Write down


what it would do in three sentences.


Boom. That's your first build. All


right. Let's try something else out now.


So we're going to say, okay, build out a


Pomodoro timer with a task list. Right?


So we're going to take this prompt over


here. Again, notes inside the AI success


lab if you want to test this stuff out


and learn from it. And then we're going


to click on that and use this to build


out a new tool. Right? We can build in


the same project if we want to. It's not


a big deal. Obviously, it's going to


overwrite the old files, but I'm not


planning to use the old files anyway.


And then we're going to build this out


as you can see. All right, so that's


beginning to to create this document,


analyze it, and start generating the


outputs. Now, in the meantime, let's run


through some more limiting beliefs that


people struggle with. So, some people


say building custom tools takes weeks or


months. And the old story was custom


software is a huge project, right?


Planning, development, testing,


revisions, it takes forever and can get


expensive. Here's the truth. I've built


working tools in less time than it takes


to make a coffee as you've seen today.


And the reason building used to take so


long wasn't because the work itself was


hard. It was because humans had to


translate your ideas into code line by


line. Now AI does the translation


instantly. The new belief that you


should have is what used to take weeks


now takes minutes. Speed is no longer


the bottleneck. And your next step is


really just time yourself. Describe a


tool and see how fast it appears cuz you


will be shocked. And you can see that's


beginning to generate. Now we've got the


output over here. You can see with the


blue line around the edges, this is


beginning to test the tool. It's a nice


little Pomodoro task, right? So, we're


going to plug in the task. The AI agent


is going to plug in the task for me


whilst I talk to you. And then it should


start the timer in a second as well.


Right. So, it's plugged in the task,


which is finished report. We'll return


to the agent. And now it started the


timer, right? So, the output worked


perfectly first time around. The UI is


nice and clean. We can actually switch


between like short break, whatever, blah


blah blah. And then we can accept all


the changes. Right? I'm going to confirm


that. And then I'm going to stop the


agent. And you can see how we can just


test this directly here, right? We can


actually run, we can grab the URL over


here as well. We can go back to our main


window and start testing this out as you


can see. So it works perfectly. We can


refresh it. We've got tasks that we can


type in. So for example, let's put live


stream here. And that's a task. And that


works beautifully, right? And we've now


built a custommade Pomodoro timer that


works perfectly first time round for


free locally whilst I've been talking to


you and just jamming on the stuff that


you can do with this. Right? So it's


amazing what you can build with this.


And it really isn't technical. Some


people say free tools can't be that


good. And the old story was like good


things are expensive and if it's free,


there must be a catch. It probably


doesn't work well, for example. But as


you've seen today, it does work well.


And here's the truth. Google gives away


powerful door tools because they want


you in their ecosystem. Email is free.


Google Docs is free. Google search is


free. And these are like the best tools


in the world. Antiggravity follows the


same pattern. Google isn't being


generous. They're being strategic. They


want you building with their AI. That


benefits them. It also benefits you a


lot. The best AI tools are often free


because big companies want you using


them. So, stop paying for expensive


subscriptions before you test free


alternatives. That's the next step. You


might be surprised what's already


available. Feel free to ask any


questions as we go along, by the way.


But you can see how powerful this is.


So, let's talk about the antique growth


action framework. 30 days to building


your business tool stack. Week one is


the foundation. Day one to two, I just


focus with your first build. To start


simple, you can build a Pomodoro timer


with task tracking like I've done today.


This just teaches you the basics.


Describe what you want, testing results,


making tweaks, and you'll have a working


productivity tool and you'll understand


how anti-gravity you think. You get two


birds in one stone. Day three to four,


your second build, right? Build a daily


time blocking planner. So now you're


getting comfortable. You know how to


describe things. You're seeing patterns


and what works. And then day to five to


seven, build your first business tool.


This could be something that you


actually need for your business. It


could be an invoice generator. It might


be a client intake form. It might be a


content calendar. Just pick something


that you do manually and automate it,


right? And then once you build something


with this, post it inside the AR profit


border inside the win section and just


share what you're building with us,


right? I really want to see what people


are building, how we're learning. You


can see all the cool stuff inside the


profit boarding community and what


people are building. It's amazing. So,


for example, like Robert Lawrence, he


said the automation light went off in my


head. I joined this group and he


realized like, oh, I can automate my


entire content creation workflow, right?


And he said he's a full-time truck


driver, doesn't have much time, but he's


learned to automate one workflow that


will help working whilst he's creating


everything else. So, it can just save so


much time when you figure out, okay,


here's what I need to do next. Let's try


something else now. So, I'm going to


take this one, as you can see, and we're


going to create a time tracking planner.


We'll plug that in to anti-gravity and


start building this tool as well. So,


that's beginning to build out. Whilst


we're waiting for that, let's talk


through some tools that you could build.


You could build the prompt library


manager. So, this could be a place to


save, organize, and find all your best


prompts. the invoice generator as I've


shown you today. The content repurposing


machine, so you could turn one piece


into your blog post, a Twitter thread,


copy each version, and that would save a


lot of time, right? You could easily


build that with anti-gravity. The daily


time blocking planner, so you can plan


your day visually, drag to create time


blocks, which we're actually building


right now with anti-gravity, as you can


see. And then we've also got the offer


builder as well, right? And so there's


so much stuff you can build with this.


And if you want to see what's possible


inside the AR profit bon members are


getting results like this, right? So if


pull this up, this is 106 pages of happy


clients from the AI profit boardroom. So


for example here, Andrew said that he


built his first AI avatar and created a


video. They'll go live on LinkedIn on


Tuesday, right? Pretty amazing. You can


see the time blocker is now being tested


by the actually just opened that up and


just started testing it. As you can see,


we've got the blue background around the


sides. It's taking screenshots, testing


things out, and it's beginning to block


things out for like deep work, gym,


lunch, color coding it, and just


planning out the day. Pretty amazing. So


you can see the AI agent is really just


testing this actually works before it


goes ahead and builds anything. Let's


open up another random page here. See


what we got. So Eric coded his first iOS


app with AI and he said I've got to give


a huge shout out to Julian for the AR


profit boardroom. The community there


has helped me so much along the way.


Right. Let's see what else we got here.


So Marcus says here's why I'm impressed


with a profit boardroom. Julian is


actually present responding to questions


showing up etc. Just going to X off


that. But you see now we've got the


planner here. I'm just going to stop


this agent cuz it's getting a bit out of


control. But you can see how to use


anti-gravity, all the tools that we


built today. So, for example, the


invoice generator, the Pomodoro timer,


and the time block pro, right? Which


actually works kind of like a calendar


app. So, it is amazing what you can do


with this stuff, how powerful it is, how


easy it is to build with this and how it


works. All right, your homework. I would


pick one tool that would help your


business the most. Describe what you


want it to do in three simple sentences.


Build it using anti-gravity. Post your


results inside their profit and yeah,


that's basically how you can get it.


Well, if you join the air profit


boardroom today, you're also going


access to the classroom with all of


these different trainings. As you can


see, you'll get access to the community


where you can post in here and get help


and support and advice and meet local


people and share friends and everything


else. And then also inside the calendar,


you have coaching calls where you can


jump on the coaching calls live with a


PhD trained professor on Jeff and then


ask any questions you want and get help


and support in real time on those live


coaching calls. Okay, so you do that


inside the AI profit boardroom. And then


also if you sign up today, you also get


access to our school training, the AI


avatar clone system where you can clone


yourself and create AI video content


like me. You'll learn how to automate


your Twitter so you can reach more


customers like I do and generate more


leads. You'll get the Empire Focus


manual, which is my personal system for


staying insanely productive and avoiding


overwhelm. You also get access to the


free SEO boardroom and also the digital


nomad blueprint as well. Right? And you


get all of this inside the apuffer


boardroom when you join today. So link


in the comments in description for that.


You can also DM me inside there and get


help and support. It's the only place I


personally connect with people and you


get that directly inside the link in the


comments description. Google dropped a


free AI tool that codes for you and


changes how SEO works forever. This


thing writes code automatically using AI


agents that think and plan like humans.


It's built on Gemini 3, Google's newest


AI brain that powers their search


results right now. and it could


completely change how you rank content


and build your business online. I'm


about to show you exactly what this


means for your SEO strategy. All right,


let's talk about what Google


Anti-gravity actually is. This is not


another code helper that finishes your


sentences. This is a full IDE, which


means a coding environment that runs AI


agents for you. These agents plan tasks,


write code, test it, and verify it works


all by themselves without you


babysitting every step. is powered by


Gemini 3 Pro, which is Google's most


advanced AI model right now. The same


model running AI mode in Google search.


The same one in the Gemini app. The same


technology behind how Google is ranking


and displaying content today. Here's


what makes this different from every


other coding tool you've tried.


Traditional idees give you autocomplete.


You type a few letters and it suggests


the rest. Anti-gravity gives you agents.


You tell it what you want to build and


it figures out how to do it. It opens


files, runs terminal commands, checks


the browser, and fixes its own mistakes.


It's like having a developer working


inside your computer. And it's free


right now. Windows, Mac, Linux, any


major programming language, Python,


JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, C++, Rust.


Now, here's where this gets interesting


for co. Gemini 3 is not just powering


anti-gravity. It's powering Google


search right now. The new AI mode in


search, the Gemini app, every API and


developer tool Google makes. This is the


brain behind how Google is understanding


and ranking content in 2025. So if you


want to understand where SEO is going,


you need to understand how this AI


thinks. Google just made Gemini 3 flash


the default model everywhere is faster


and cheaper than the old version. More


capable too. And it's rolling out across


search APIs, Google AI Studio, Vertex


AI, and anti-gravity. This is the new


standard for how Google processes


information, which means it's the new


standard for how your content needs to


be structured. Traditional SEO is dying


fast. Keyword stuffing is dead. Backlink


farms are dead. Writing for algorithms


is dead because Google is not using


simple algorithms anymore. They're using


AI that reads content like a human. It


understands context. It checks


authority. It scans for structure. It


decides if your content is worth citing


or not. This is called generative engine


optimization, geo, not SEO, because


Google is not just ranking pages


anymore. It's generating answers. And if


your content is not built for AI to scan


understanded site, you're invisible. You


could have perfect keywords and a


million back links and still get zero


traffic because the AI doesn't trust


you. Here's what AI search actually


looks for. High authority content,


structured data, semantic alignment,


third party citations, scannable


formatting, justified claims. If your


page looks like a wall of text with no


sources and no structure, AI skips it.


If your page has schema markup, clear


headings, cited sources, and logical


flow, AI uses it. One more thing, if


you're creating all this content with


anti-gravity, but nobody is finding it


online, you've got a traffic problem.


That's where SEO comes in. If you want


more leads, more traffic, and more


sales, my team can help you rank higher


on Google. Check the link in the


comments and description to order AI SEO


online and let us handle your back links


while you focus on growing your


business. Let me show you how this works


in practice. Let's say you're building


content for AI profit boardroom. That's


a community teaching AI automation for


businesses. Old SEO would say write an


article about AI automation tools and


stuff it with keywords. New SEO says


build a resource that AI can scan and


site. That means structured data telling


Google what your page is about. That


means clear sections with headings. That


means linking to authority sources. That


means formatting that AI can pass in


milliseconds. Let's talk about practical


ways you can use anti-gravity. Right


now, first, you can autogenerate landing


pages. Imagine you need a new landing


page for AI profit boardroom. You tell


anti-gravity to design a landing page


that converts, shows the value of AI


automation, and explains the benefits of


the community. It writes the HTML, CSS,


and JavaScript. It tests the layout in a


browser. It fixes responsive design


issues. It creates a working page in


minutes instead of hours. Second, you


can generate SEO optimized content


drafts. Tell anti-gravity to write an


article about AI automation for small


businesses. It researches the topic


using Gemini 3. It structures the


content with proper headings. It


includes schema markup. It formats


everything for AI readability. You get a


first draft that's already built for


generative search. And you can build


agentpowered workflows. Let's say you


want to automate outreach for AI profit


boardroom. You tell anti-gravity to


build a system that finds potential


members, personalizes messages, and


tracks responses. The agent writes the


code, tests it, and hands you a working


automation. You didn't write a single


line of code yourself. This is the power


of agent first development. You're not


coding anymore. You're directing. You


tell the AI what you want, and it


figures out how to build it. That's why


Google is betting big on this. Because


if AI can code, design, test, and deploy


software by itself, everyone becomes a


builder. You don't need to know Python


or JavaScript. You just need to know


what you want to create. Now, let's talk


about installing this thing. You go to


the Google Developers site and download


Anti-Gravity for your operating system,


Windows, Mac, or Linux. The file is


about 500 megabytes. You install it like


any other app. When you open it, you log


in with your Google account that


connects you to Gemini 3 Pro. Then, you


create a new project and start giving


the agent instructions. The interface


looks like a normal code editor. You've


got files on the left, code in the


middle, terminal at the bottom, but


there's also an agent panel where you


chat with the AI. You type what you want


to build. The agent asks clarifying


questions. Then it starts working. You


watch it open files, write code, run


tests, and check results. It creates


artifacts, which are verifiable outputs


of what it did. You can review


everything and approve or modify it.


Here's a real example. Let's say you


want to build a lead magnet page for AI


profit boardroom. You tell anti-gravity


to create a page that collects emails in


exchange for a free AI automation guide.


You describe the design, the copy style,


and the functionality you want. The


agent builds the HTML structure, writes


the CSS for styling, adds JavaScript for


form validation, and creates a backend


script to save emails. It tests


everything in a browser window. It shows


you the working page. You make tweaks by


chatting with the agent. It updates the


code in real time. In 20 minutes, you


have a fully functional lead magnet page


ready to deploy. Compare that to


traditional development. You'd write


HTML for structure, then CSS for design,


then JavaScript for interactivity, then


backend code for data handling, then


test everything manually, then debug


issues, then test again. That's hours or


days of work. Anti-gravity does it in


minutes because the agent handles all


the steps. This is why Gemini 3 and


anti-gravity matter for your business.


You can build faster, test faster,


launch faster. And because Gemini 3


powers Google search, the content and


tools you build are already aligned with


how Google ranks and displays


information. You're not guessing what


works for AI search. You're using the


same AI that runs Google search. This is


the new game, generative engine


optimization. Your content needs to be


good enough that an AI model feels


confident citing it as a source. That's


a higher bar than traditional SEO, but


it's also more rewarding because when AI


trusts you, you get featured in AI


generated answers. You get visibility in


AI mode search results. You get traffic


from people who never even click through


to traditional links. And here's the


thing, most businesses are not ready for


this. They're still doing old school


SEO. They're still chasing keywords and


back links without understanding how AI


processes content. Which means there's a


massive opportunity right now for anyone


who adapts fast. If you start building


content for AI search today, you're


ahead of 95% of your competition. So,


here's what you need to do. Download


anti-gravity and start experimenting.


Build tools and pages that serve your


audience. Structure your content for AI


readability. Add schema markup to


everything. Get cited by authority


sources. Focus on depth and context


instead of keywords. And most


importantly, understand that Google's AI


is not just ranking content. It's


deciding what's worth showing at all.


And one more thing, if you're creating


all this content with anti-gravity, but


nobody is finding it online, you've got


a traffic problem. That's where SEO


comes in. If you want more leads, more


traffic, and more sales, my team can


help you rank higher on Google. Check

your back links while you focus on

Anti-gravity Gemini 3.0 plus free opus


4.5 is insane. Today, I'm going to show


you how Google Gemini 3.0 Zero just


changed the game with their new


anti-gravity feature and Claude Opus 4.5


is now completely free. These are the


two most powerful AI tools right now and


they just got massive upgrades. By the


end of this video, you'll know exactly


what these tools can do and how to use


them. Google just dropped Gemini 3.0.


This is their newest AI model and it's


got something they're calling


anti-gravity. Now, before you think this


is about physics or floating objects,


let me tell you what it actually does.


It's a complete overhaul of how Gemini


processes and generates images. The


speed is insane. The quality is better,


and it can handle way more complex


prompts than before. I'm talking about


prompts that are 500 words long,


detailed descriptions, multiple objects,


specific lighting, exact colors. Before,


if you gave Gemini a super long prompt,


it would get confused. It would miss


details. It would forget parts of what


you asked for. Now, with Gemini 3.0, you


can throw everything at it, and it


handles it perfectly. Here's what


changed under the hood. Google rebuilt


the entire image processing system. They


call it anti-gravity because it lifts


the weight off the model. Think about it


like this. Old Gemini was carrying a


backpack full of rocks while trying to


create images. New Gemini dropped the


backpack. It's faster. It's cleaner. It


processes your requests without slowing


down. The quality jump is massive, too.


Images look more realistic. Colors are


more accurate. Lighting is better.


Shadows make sense. Before you'd get


weird artifacts in your images, random


blobs, distorted faces, hands with six


fingers. Gemini 3.0 fixed most of that,


not all of it. The speed improvement is


wild. Old Gemini took about 30 seconds


to generate an image, sometimes longer


if your prompt was complex. Gemini 3.0


does it in under 10 seconds. That's


three times faster. Uh, you can iterate


way quicker now. Try one idea, don't


like it, try another. You're not sitting


around waiting anymore. Now, if you want


to dive even deeper into AI automation,


I've got something special for you. I


run a community called the AI Profit


Boardroom. The best place to scale your


business, get more customers, and save


hundreds with AI automation. Learn how


to save time and automate your business


with AI tools. The link is in the


comments and description. It's at


school.com/iiprofitlab.


Now, let's talk about Claude Opus 4.5.


This just went free, completely free. No


catch. Anthropic decided to make their


most powerful model available to


everyone. This is huge. Opus 4.5 is


their smartest model. Better than


Sonnet, better than Haiku, and now you


don't have to pay for it. What can Opus


4.5 do? Everything. Writing, coding,


analysis, problem solving. It's got a


massive context window. That means it


can remember way more information in a


conversation. You can feed it entire


documents, whole code bases, long


research papers, and it keeps track of


everything. The writing quality on Opus


4.5 is insane. It doesn't sound like AI


anymore. It sounds human, natural,


conversational. You can ask it to write


in any style, formal, casual, technical,


creative, and it nails it every time.


Before, you'd read AI writing and think,


"Yeah, that's obviously AI." With Opus


4.5, people can't tell the difference.


Coding got a massive upgrade, too. Opus


4.5 can write entire applications, not


just snippets, full programs. It


understands complex logic. It can debug


your code. It can explain what's wrong


and fix it. I've seen people build


entire web apps with just OPUS 4.5. No


other tools needed. Here's the thing


that makes OPUS 4.5 different from other


AI models. It actually thinks through


problems. Most AI just spits out answers


fast. Opus 4.5 takes its time. It breaks


down the problem. It considers different


approaches. It gives you the best


solution, not just the first solution.


The analysis capabilities are next


level. You can feed it data,


spreadsheets, reports, research papers,


and it finds patterns you'd miss. It


connects dots. It gives you insights


that would take hours to figure out


manually. I'm talking about deep


analysis here, not surface level stuff.


Now, let me tell you why having both of


these tools is powerful. Gemini 3.0 is


your image powerhouse. Opus 4.5 is your


text and logic powerhouse. together they


cover everything. Need to create visual


content? Use Gemini. Need to write


something complex or solve a problem?


Use Opus. Need both? Use both. Here's a


real world example. Say you're creating


content for a website. You need images.


You need text. You need everything to


match. Before you'd use one AI for


images, another for text. They wouldn't


match. The style would be off. The tone


would be different. Now, you can use


Gemini 3.0 for all your images. Same


style, same quality. Then use Opus 4.5


for all your text. Everything flows


together. The fact that Opus 4.5 is free


changes everything. Before you had to


pay monthly, now anyone can use it.


Students, creators, small teams,


everyone gets access to the best AI


writing and coding tool available.


That's massive. Let me talk about the


technical side for a second. Gemini 3.0


runs on Google's TPUv5 chips. These are


customuilt for AI workloads, way faster


than regular GPUs. That's part of why


the speed improved so much. Google


optimized everything from the ground up.


Opus 4.5 uses a different architecture.


Anthropic built it to be safer and more


aligned. That means it's less likely to


make things up. It's more accurate. It


follows instructions better. And it


refuses fewer requests because it


actually understands context better.


Both tools have been trained on massive


data sets. We're talking about trillions


of parameters. Gemini 3.0 was trained on


images, text, video, and audio. It's


truly multimodal. Opus 4.5 focuses on


text and code, but goes way deeper.


Quality over quantity. Here's what you


need to know about using Gemini 3.0


effectively. Be specific with your


prompts. The more detail you give, the


better the better your output will be.


Use the anti-gravity feature to your


advantage. This means you can ask for


complex scenes, multiple objects,


different angles, specific perspectives.


Don't hold back. Push the limits. See


what it can do. For Opus 4.5, structure


matters. When you ask it to do something


complex, break it down. Give it steps.


Say, first analyze this, then do that,


then conclude with this. It follows


instructions perfectly. When you're


clear, use the long context window.


Don't try to cram everything into short


prompts. Give it all the information it


needs. Background, context, examples.


The more you feed it, the better it


performs. Let's talk about what makes


these updates different from previous


releases. Most AI updates are


incremental, slightly better, slightly


faster. These updates are


transformational. Gemini 3.0 isn't just


a bit better than Gemini 2.0. It's a


completely different beast. The


anti-gravity system is a fundamental


redesign. Same with Opus 4.5 going free.


This isn't just a price change. It's a


strategic move that opens up the most


powerful AI model to millions of people


who couldn't afford it before. That's


going to accelerate AI adoption like


crazy. The competition between AI


companies is heating up. Google wants to


dominate image generation. Anthropic


wants to be the go-to for writing and


coding. Open AI is somewhere in the


middle trying to do everything. The this


competition is good for us. It means


faster updates, better features, lower


prices. Here's something most people


don't realize. These AI models get


better every single day. They don't just


update once every few months. The


training continues. The fine-tuning


continues every time you use them.


You're using a slightly better version


than yesterday. That's wild. Gemini 3.0


learns from every image it generates. If


something doesn't look right, the


feedback goes back into the system. Next


time it creates something similar, it's


better. This continuous improvement is


built into the core system. Opus 4.5


does the same thing with text and code.


Every conversation makes it smarter.


Every correction teaches it something


new. This isn't static technology. It's


living technology that evolves. Let me


address something important. Some people


worry about AI replacing jobs. That's


not what's happening here. These tools


amplify what you can do. They don't


replace you. Think about it. Before


calculators, people did math by hand.


Calculators didn't replace


mathematicians. They made math faster


and more accessible. Same thing here.


Gemini 3.0 doesn't replace designers. It


lets designers work faster and try more


ideas. Opus 4.5 doesn't replace writers.


It lets writers focus on the creative


parts while handling the repetitive


stuff. The people who win with AI are


the ones who learn how to use it


effectively. That's why understanding


these tools matters, not just knowing


they exist. Actually knowing how to use


them. Now, if you want to dive even


deeper into AI automation, I've got


something special for you. I run a


community called the AI Profit


Boardroom. The best place to scale your


business, get more customers, and save


hundreds with AI automation. Learn how


to save time and automate your business.


The link is in the comments and


description. It's at


school.com/iprofitlab.


And if you want the full process, SOPs


and 100 plusa I use cases like this one.


Join the AI success lab. Links in the


comments and description. Google just


launched something wild. It's called


anti-gravity and it came out on November


18th, 2025. This is not just another


coding tool. Most AI coding tools give


you suggestions. They help you write


code faster. But anti-gravity, it


actually builds entire apps for you.


full apps with testing, with browser


automation, with everything. And I'm


going to show you exactly how to use it.


So, what is anti-gravity? It's an AI


powered IDE built on top of a Visual


Studio Code. If you've used VS Code


before, this will feel familiar, but


Google added AI agents. And these agents


don't just help you, they actually do


the work for you. You tell the AI what


you want, like build me a stock tracking


app. And then the AI goes away and


builds it. It writes the code. It opens


the browser. It tests everything. It


takes screenshots. It debugs issues. You


just watch it work. When you first open


anti-gravity, you see something that


looks like VS Code. But here's the


secret. You're not going to use that


screen much. Instead, click on the agent


manager. This is where the magic


happens. The agent manager is like a


control center. You can see all your AI


agents working. You can manage multiple


projects at once. It's like being a


manager of a whole team. But the team is


AI. The agent manager has three main


parts. First, workspaces. This is where


your main projects live. Second,


playgrounds. This is where you test


ideas quickly. Third, the inbox. This is


where your AI agents message you when


they're done or need approval. Let me


walk you through building something. Say


you want to build a stock tracking app.


You open a workspace, create a new


folder, an AI agent appears. Now, here's


a pro tip. Give it good instructions. Be


specific. Tell it what text stack to


use. Tell it what features you want. And


here's the key. Give it visual


inspiration. Gemini 3 powers


anti-gravity and it's amazing at


building user interfaces, but only if


you show it what you want. Here's what


you do. Go to a tool called VZero.


Describe the UI you want. Vzero builds


it in seconds. Take a screenshot, paste


it into anti-gravity, tell it to use


that as inspiration. This makes a huge


difference. And before I go further, if


you want to learn how to use AI tools


like anti-gravity to automate your


business and save hours every single


day, check out AI Profit Boardroom. We


dive deep into AI automation. We show


you exactly how to use tools like this


to build apps, automate tasks, and get


more done. No fluff, just real


strategies. Link in the description. So,


you give the agent your instructions.


You attach your screenshot, hit send,


the agent starts working, and as it


works, it creates artifacts. What are


artifacts? When they're documents,


plans, screenshots, code files.


Everything the agent does gets saved.


You can open the implementation plan.


While the agent is working, you can read


what it's planning to do. You can review


everything step by step. Here's another


cool feature. The agent tests your app


as it builds it. It opens a browser. It


clicks buttons. It enters text. It takes


screenshots all automatically. Because


Google makes Chrome, they integrated it


perfectly. The AI has full control over


the browser. Now, here's a pro tip


nobody talks about. As the AI is testing


your app, you can leave annotations. You


see a screenshot, you notice something


you want to change, you can highlight


part of the screenshot, leave a comment,


like add a crypto section here. The AI


will see that comment and start working


on it. You're giving feedback in real


time. But here's where anti-gravity gets


really interesting. You can spin up more


agents. Click the plus button in agent


manager. Create a second agent. Tell it


to add portfolio tracking. Now you have


two agents working at the same time.


They work in parallel. They don't


interfere with each other. You can


create different types of agents, not


just coding agents. Create a product


manager agent. Tell it to look at your


app and create a road map. Create a


marketing agent. Tell it to write blog


posts and tweets. You can have a whole


team of AI agents, each one doing


different work. You're just managing


them. And those playgrounds,


say you're working on your main app, but


suddenly you have an idea for something


completely different, maybe a game. You


don't want to mess up your main


workspace. Go to the playground, create


a new experiment, tell the AI to build


it. If you like it, move it to a


workspace. If you don't, delete it. Now,


let's talk about the inbox. As you have


multiple agents working, they all


communicate through the inbox. Agent


one, finish the portfolio feature


message. Agent two, finish the marketing


content message. Everything shows up in


one place. You can review each thing.


You can approve or reject. You can give


more instructions. Here's the mindset


shift you need. With normal coding,


you're the builder. You write every


line. But with anti-gravity, you're the


manager. You tell your team what to


build. They go build it. They come back


with questions. You give approval. This


is huge. You're not bottlenecked by how


fast you can type code. You're only


limited by how many agents you can


manage. Now, I want to be real with you.


Anti-gravity is not perfect. It's still


in public preview. There are bugs. There


are issues. Sometimes the AI doesn't


follow instructions perfectly. Gemini 3


has some rough edges compared to Claude,


but Google is working on it. Here's


something important. Anti-gravity agents


have a lot of power. They can edit code.


They can run terminal commands. They can


control your browser. This creates


security risks. Some researchers found


vulnerabilities right after launch.


There was even a case where someone used


turbo mode and the agent accidentally


deleted their entire hard drive. No


warning, just deleted everything. So,


here's my advice. Always back up your


work. Don't use anti-gravity for


critical production projects yet. Treat


it like an experimental sandbox, but for


side projects, for prototypes, for


learning, anti-gravity is amazing. You


can build apps so fast. Just be smart


about it. Use planning mode instead of


fast mode for complex tasks. Review the


artifacts. Don't blindly trust


everything. Check the code. Be the


manager. Stay in control. Here are the


key practices. Always back up your work.


Use planning mode for anything complex.


Give the AI visual inspiration. Read the


artifacts as the AI works. Use


annotations on screenshots. Start


simple. Build a small app first. Get


comfortable with the workflow, then


tackle bigger projects. You can build


web apps, stock trackers, toou apps,


portfolio sites, games, admin


dashboards, pretty much anything. You


can use it to prototype ideas fast. You


can use it to learn coding by watching


how the AI builds things. And the text


stack is flexible. Anti-gravity supports


Nex.js, JS, React, Vue, plain HTML and


CSS, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, and


more. If you want to master AI


automation and learn how to use


cuttingedge tools like anti-gravity to


transform how you work, join AI Profit


Boardroom. We're constantly testing new


tools, finding what works, and teaching


you exactly how to implement them. This


is where you learn to stay ahead. Link


in the description. Here's what makes


this different from every other AI tool


out there. Most tools are stuck in chat


mode. You ask a question, it gives an


answer. You ask another question, it


gives another answer. It's slow. It's


tedious. But anti-gravity breaks that


model completely. Your agents work


independently. They make decisions. They


test things. They fix bugs. They don't


wait for you to hold their hand. This is


the first time we've seen truly


autonomous AI coding, and it changes


everything. Here's what you need to do


right now. Go download anti-gravity.


It's free. Google is giving tons of free


credits. Install it. Open the agent


manager. Create a workspace. Build


something simple, a to-do app, a


calculator, anything. Then start


experimenting with multiple agents.


Create a playground. Try different


ideas. Get comfortable with the


workflow. The key things to remember,


use visual inspiration for better UIs.


Use planning mode for complex tasks.


Annotate screenshots to give better


feedback. Spin up multiple agents for


different tasks. Use playgrounds for


quick experiments. Check your inbox


regularly. Back up your work. And shift


your mindset from builder to manager.


Today we're talking about anti-gravity.


This is Google's brand new AI


development platform, and it's wild.


This thing can build full apps from


scratch. It can fix bugs automatically.


It can even create pull requests for


you. But before you go crazy with it, I


need to show you something important


because there it's been some scary


incidents already. I'll get to that in a


minute. But first, let me show you what


this thing can actually do. Anti-gravity


is basically an AI agent that lives


inside your development environment.


It's not just a code helper. It's a full


autonomous agent. It can plan tasks,


execute them, and verify everything


worked. And it does all of this across


your editor, your terminal, and your


browser. The platform is powered by


Gemini 3. That's Google's latest AI


model, and it's specifically built for


agentic work. The AI can break down big


tasks into smaller steps, execute each


step, check if it worked, and move to


the next one, all without you doing


anything. Here's what makes anti-gravity


different. Most AI tools just suggest


code. You still have to copy it, paste


it, run it yourself. Anti-gravity does


all of that automatically. It edits your


files directly. It runs terminal


commands. It can even open your browser


and test your app. Now, I know what


you're thinking. That sounds powerful,


but also kind of scary. And you're


right. Let me tell you about what


happened recently. There was an incident


where a developer used anti-gravity's


turbo mode. The AI agent started running


commands and it accidentally deleted a


bunch of important files. just gone


because the agent had full access to the


terminal. Security researchers have been


warning about this. They found that


these agents can be tricked with prompt


injection. Basically, bad actors could


hide malicious instructions in files.


And when the AI reads those files, it


executes those instructions. That could


mean stealing your API keys, deleting


your database, or exposing sensitive


data. So, here's the deal. Anti-gravity


is incredibly powerful, but you need to


use it safely. I'm going to show you


exactly how to do that. Let's start with


the coolest demo. Building a complete


app from nothing. I'm going to ask


Anti-gravity to create a to-do app with


React Express SQLite tests, a Docker


file, and a CI pipeline. Here's the


exact prompt. Create a todo app using


React Plus Express plus SQLite. Add


tests docker file and create a GitHub


actions pipeline. Watch what happens.


The agent creates a plan. It breaks down


the task into steps. Then it starts


executing. You can see it creating files


in real time. app.jsx for React,


server.js for Express, database, schema,


test files, everything. Now it moves to


the terminal. It installs dependencies,


runs the tests, the test pass, then it


builds the Docker container and starts


the app locally. I can open my browser,


and there it is, a fully working to-do


app. I can add tasks, check them off,


delete them, everything works. And I


didn't write a single line of code. That


took maybe 3 minutes to build something


that would normally take hours. But


here's what I want you to notice. Before


the agent ran any terminal commands, it


showed me what it was about to do. I


could approve or reject each action.


That's important. Julian Goldie reads


every comment. So, make sure you comment


below and let me know what kind of app


you'd build with this. Here's another


workflow that's super useful. Let's say


you have a project with failing tests.


You know something's broken, but you


don't know what. With anti-gravity, you


can just ask it to fix the problem.


Here's my prompt. Investigate failing


unit tests. Reproduce locally. propose


and apply a fix, add a regression test,


and create a PR. The agent looks at the


test output, sees which tests are


failing, then it examines the code to


find the root cause. The agent writes a


fix, updates the code, runs the tests


again, and now they all pass. But it


doesn't stop there. It also writes a new


test to make sure this bug doesn't


happen again. Then it creates a pull


request with a detailed commit message


explaining what was wrong and how it was


fixed. This is huge for developers


because bug fixing takes up so much


time. And this agent can do it


automatically. Before I show you the


third demo, let me tell you about


something really cool. If you want to


learn how to actually use AI tools like


anti-gravity to save time and automate


your business, you need to check out AI


Profit Boardroom. This is where we show


you the exact AI tools and workflows


that can transform how you work. Whether


you're building apps, creating content,


or running a business, AI can handle the


boring stuff so you can focus on what


matters. Click the link in the


description to learn more. This third


workflow is where safety really matters.


Let's say you need to refactor some code


and run a security scan. Here's my


prompt. Refactor function Y to improve


performance and run a secret scan. Do


not change production configs or push


secrets. Notice how I specifically told


it not to touch production configs.


That's important. You need to give the


agent clear boundaries. The agent starts


the refactor, cleans up the code, then


it runs the security scan. The scan


finds a potential issue. There's an API


key hard-coded in a config file. The


agent flags this. It shows me a warning


and it asks if I want to proceed. I can


reject this action or I can tell it to


remove the API key and use environment


variables instead. This is the evidence


trailing action. Every step the agent


takes is logged. So, you can review what


happened and make sure nothing dangerous


was executed. Okay, let's talk about how


to use this safely because like I said,


there have been incidents. Here are the


rules. Rule number one, always run


agents in a sandbox or a dedicated


virtual machine. Never run them on


production servers. Rule number two,


disable automatic destructive commands.


No automatic RM RF, no global pseudo


access. Rule number three, require


manual approval for any terminal


commands that could be dangerous. Rule


number four, always review the evidence


logs before you accept any changes. Read


through what the agent did. Rule number


five, use dummy credentials for testing.


Don't give the agent access to real API


keys or production databases. And rule


number six, avoid using turbo mode on


anything important. Turbo mode lets the


agent run faster by skipping approval


steps, but that's exactly how things go


wrong. These rules might seem like


overkill, but trust me, they're not.


Security researchers have found real


vulnerabilities, prompt injection


attacks, file exfiltration risks,


destructive command execution. The good


news is that Google is aware of these


issues and they're working on better


safeguards. But until those are in


place, you need to protect yourself.


Here's why anti-gravity is such a big


deal. With tools like this, anyone can


build software. You just need to know


what you want to build. The AI handles


the technical details. That means more


people can turn their ideas into real


products. Small businesses can build


custom tools without hiring expensive


developers. Entrepreneurs can test ideas


faster. But this technology is brand


new. is still in public preview. There


will be bugs, there will be mistakes,


and yes, there will be security issues.


That's why you need to learn how to use


it safely. Now, if you want to stay


ahead of AI tools like this, you need to


join AI Profit Boardroom. We break down


every new AI tool, show you how to use


them, and teach you how to automate your


business safely. Click the link in the


description to learn more. All right,


that's anti-gravity, Google's new AI


agent platform. It can build full apps,


fix bugs automatically, and handle


complex development workflows. Let me


walk you through how this actually


works. Let's say you want to build an


app. You tell the anti-gravity agent to


initialize Firebase in your project. The


agent then generates an implementation


plan. If it needs more info from you, it


asks questions. When it's done, it shows


you a step-by-step walkthrough of what


it did. The whole process is automated,


but you're still in control. Now, here's


a real example. Someone used


anti-gravity to build a racing game.


They asked for email and password


signin. They asked for a cloud fire


store leaderboard and anti-gravity using


Firebase MCP tools did everything


automatically. It fetched the API keys.


It added authentication. It set up the


fire store logic. It wrote the game


code. Then it just worked. No debugging,


no fixing errors. It just worked. Think


about what this means. You're not


writing Firebase initialization code


anymore. You're not hunting for API keys


in the console. You're not setting up,


you know, authentication flows manually.


You're not writing database rules. The


the AI agent does all of this and it


does it right the first time. The


deployment part is even crazier. Once


your app is built, the agent already


knows how to deploy. It uses Firebase


hosting. It checks all the steps using


MCP. Then it runs Firebase deploy only


hosting fully automated. You ask it to


deploy and it deploys. And the MCP


server also supports app hosting for


Nex.js and Angular apps. And this is


where things get interesting because


Firebase MCP works with Gemini agents


too. So you're not just limited to


anti-gravity. You can use these same


tools in other environments. The


protocol is open, which means more AI


tools will start using it. And when they


do, app development becomes even easier.


Now, if you're watching this and


thinking, "Holy crap, I need to learn


how to build apps with AI tools like


anti-gravity and Firebase MCP," then you


need to join my AI profit boardroom.


This is where I teach you how to use AI


agents and automation tools to build


real products. You'll learn how to scale


your business with the exact same AI


development tools I'm showing you today.


You'll get access to workflows that show


you how to automate app development, how


to use MCP servers, how to build with AI


agents like the ones in anti-gravity.


Plus, you'll save hundreds of hours


because you'll learn which AI tools


actually work. So, back at it, the speed


of development with this setup is


insane. Apps that used to take weeks now


take hours. Apps that used to take days


now take minutes. And the quality


doesn't drop because the AI is following


best practices. It's using the right


Firebase features. is setting up proper


security. It's not cutting corners. And


here's something most people miss. When


you use Firebase MCP with anti-gravity,


you're also learning because the agent


explains what it's doing. It shows you


the code it writes. It walks you through


the Firebase setup. So, even if you're


not a Firebase expert now, you will be


after using this. You'll understand how


everything connects. You'll understand


why certain patterns work. You'll level


up your skills while the AI does the


work. The deployment process is


seamless, too. Once your app is ready,


anti-gravity can push it live. It


handles the hosting configuration. It


sets up the domain. It manages the build


process. You go from idea to live app


without switching tools. Everything


happens in one place. And if something


needs to change, the agent can update


and redeploy just as easily. Here's what


you should do next. If you're building


apps, try anti-gravity. Add the Firebase


MCP server. Build something small first.


See how it works. See what the agent can


do and scale up. Build something bigger.


Push the limits. because this technology


is new and the people who learn it now


will have a huge advantage. Now, let me


tell you what Google has been working on


behind the scenes. They've been making


sure that the Firebase MCP server works


really well with not only the Gemini


CLI, but all the places where you might


want to use an MCP server. And the


biggest one is anti-gravity IDE,


Google's newest release. So, they built


this integration from the ground up to


be seamless. and it shows. Here's


exactly how you add Firebase MCP to


anti-gravity. You open anti-gravity. You


go to the drop-own menu in the agent


window. You select MCP servers. Then you


choose Firebase from the list of


available MCP servers. This opens a


description of the MCP server. And you


just click install. That's it. The


Firebase MCP server is now added to


anti-gravity. And now the real magic


starts. So the first thing you want to


do is link your current app to Firebase.


You tell the agent to initialize


Firebase in your current project. The


agent then develops an implementation


plan. It uses the MCP server to link


Firebase to your project. If the agent


needs more information to complete a


task, it pauses and asks for your input.


You answer, it continues. Once the task


is complete, anti-gravity provides a


walkthrough of the steps it took to link


Firebase to your app. So, you're not


just getting results, you're learning


the process. Now, here's where it gets


fun. You can ask anti-gravity to


actually build your app. Using


anti-gravity, you can specify a series


of steps that you want the agent to take


in building your app. Someone prompted


it to build a racing game. They wanted


sign in using email and password login


from Firebase. They wanted Cloud Fire


Store for a leaderboard and anti-gravity


using its suite of MCP tools from the


Firebase MCP server fetch the API keys


for the web app automatically. No need


to visit the Firebase console. It


implemented both features without issue.


Then they tested the game and it worked


exactly as expected first try. But it


doesn't stop at building. You can deploy


the app with Firebase hosting too. The


anti-gravity agent already has access to


Firebase hosting via the Firebase MCP


server. The agent can consult with the


Firebase MCP server to verify the steps


to deploy to Firebase hosting. The agent


makes a deployment plan. This includes


compiling the code, then running the


Firebase deploy only hosting command to


get the app onto Firebase hosting. You


don't need to run any commands yourself.


You just ask the agent to deploy for


you. Once this is done, you can share


the game you built with your friends or


your customers or whoever you want. And


the Firebase MCP server also supports


app hosting which is optimized for


server rendered Nex.js and Angular web


apps. So if you're building more complex


applications, you're covered there, too.


So here's my final thought. Anti-gravity


plus Firebase MCP isn't just an IDE


update. It's the future of app


development. AI agents with full


control. I have full automation. your


ideas turned into fully built apps. And


we're seeing this happen right now. Not


in five years, not in 10 years, right


now. 2025 is going to be wild. This is


how you accelerate your app development


with anti-gravity, with the Firebase,


MCP server, and with AI agents that


actually work. Now, if you're watching


this and thinking, "Holy crap, I need to


learn how to build apps with AI tools


like anti-gravity and Firebase MCP,"


then you need to join my AI profit


boardroom. This is where I teach you how


to use AI agents and automation tools to


build real products. You'll learn how to


scale your business with the exact same


AI development tools I'm showing you


today. You'll get access to workflows


that show you how to automate app


development, how to use MCP servers, how


to build with AI agents like the ones in


anti-gravity, plus you'll save hundreds


of hours because you'll learn which AI


tools. So, what I'm going to try now,


I'm going to take


my landing page here for my backlink


portal. Take that, screenshot it.


We're going to open up a new project


inside


the ID. So, if we go to


new window and we'll close this old one.


Let's close that. There we go. Open up a


new folder. We'll call this new folder


website Black Friday. SEO website Black


Friday. Open up. Then I'm going to say


right past. So we've got the screenshot


here and we're going to say okay create


better more


modern version of this page this landing


page/epage website. Then I'm going to


say direct all the traffic to my SEO


checkout page. That's your services URL


equals that. We should be good to go on


that. All right. And we'll see what we


can build out here. I want to switch


back. Hit the limit on. All right. Let's


switch back to Claude Sonic. You can


actually check which ones you've hit the


limit on. So you can see here, for


example, Gemini High, uh, not available


until 9:34 a.m., right? Which is 4 hours


away for me. I'm an early riser. I'm


doing this live stream super early. And


then we've got another one, Gemini 3


Pro, that's not available until 9:34


a.m. So, it's loading it right here. But


yeah, you can use these for like website


redesign, apps, SAS tools, etc. Just


give it whatever idea you want. Now, I


mean, some people are going to say,


right, I'm not smart enough to use AI


tools, but you know, anti-gravity


understands


whatever you want without having to to


really be very clear about what you


want, right? Like, if you have an idea,


you're good to go. Yeah. So, you can you


can just basically give this what you


want. Another one is some people say


like anti-gravity is a little bit


overwhelming, but you can literally just


type in one sentence into anti-gravity


and it'll it'll basically give you


exactly what you want as you've seen


today. Some people say I'm scared of


like breaking something, but


anti-gravity actually keeps your history


of what you've created. So, you can like


just go back and undo what you've done


previously. Some people say it looks too


advanced. But even though this tool can


be advanced, you can use it in a really


simple way, too. And also, this works


with like any normal file. So you don't


need to be a code or anything like that.


Um yeah, and the other cool thing is


it's hosted locally as well. So, you


know, you can come back to it when you


want. You've got privacy and that sort


of thing. Now, I want to show you this


30-day plan as well, right? So, I would,


you know, I would test out for like 1 to


3 days. Just give it some small tasks.


Then day four to 7, sort of help, you


know, let it help you fix things. Ask it


why it made certain changes. Uh start


looking at the explanations. And then


you know day 8 to 14 you can start


building out a real project. Let it


organize all the messy side of things


and ask it to explain the whole system


to you too. Then you can build new


features. Maybe day 15 to 20 you build


one new feature or one new feature a


day. And you can also then start using


like the browser, the terminal, the


editor. And yeah, you know, you can


learn this stuff in like 30 days. Pretty


simple and easy. So let's see what we


got back here. Anti-gravity is still


coding out there. I think it's a little


bit slow with claw 4.5 to be funny to be


honest, especially when you're starting


that new project from from scratch. We


got Igore. Hello Igore. Good to see you.


And if we go back to anti-gravity now,


it's beginning to create the


foundations. So, we're pasting in that


screenshot, giving it ideas of what we


want. But again, like if it's a brand


new project from scratch, it may take a


little while, right, to to really start


coming back in. And then you can open up


previous projects here as well. So, if


you right click the icon,


you've got your window that's actually


open with your project and then you can


open up these test projects here. So, I


could open up my website or the Black


Friday website, the test project as a


folder inside the IDE, too.


And again, you can switch between


planning and fast. So, now it's


beginning to code that out. It's giving


us all the code inside the index html.


That's just creating the foundation.


Obviously, it needs to create the CSS


and everything else. I can accept the


changes there and then it will keep


going. Someone's asking like does it


have usage limits? So yeah, like you


have limits on each of the APIs you use.


Now these are free APIs you're using.


But you can see that we I can't use


Gemini 3.0 for like 3 hours now or 5


hours. So these two I can't use for a


while. So it's actually 4 hours I can't


use it for because it's not It tells you


when it's available, right? So it says


you've reached a quot limit for Gemini 3


Pro low. You can resume using this model


at 9:34 a.m. which is not great. That is


not great. So, I'm kind of locked out


from improving it with Gemini 3 for 4


hours. And then Claude Sonnet and Claude


4.5 Sonet Thinking and GT OSS I can


still use in the meantime. But the


problem is they're not as good at


coding, right? So, that's one of the


biggest issues you're going to find.


People says, "Oh, no, I used to follow


you on YouTube, but I started seeing AI


avatar videos and then I stopped


watching, but like let's see it again."


Well, it's good to have you back. Thanks


for watching again. like you can just


watch the live streams if you want and


then you skip all the AI avatar stuff.


Does it have a minimum model which you


can use when all your limits are full?


Yeah. So it' be GPTO OSS that you would


use for that, right? So for the minimum


model you use GPTO OSS. So I mean the


thing is right now you know probably


from everything that you've seen right


now like you're probably spending about


40 hours a week uh doing tasks that AI


could handle in minutes. So from what I


see inside the comments and everything


else today like a lot of people are


struggling with AI. Um, if you need help


with this, like check out the AI profit


boarding. All right, so for example,


we've got inside the AI profit boarding,


we have the we have the AI automation


blueprint and basically this shows you


how to build AI systems that run on


autopilot so you can stop wasting time


on repetitive tasks. So for example, if


we go inside the AI profit volume here,


you can see automations for content


creation, lead generation, shorts, etc.


AI avatar videos. These are all sorts of


things that are included inside the


community. Um, we also have the advanced


Facebook ads growth training. So, this


is my complete playbook for building


engaged audiences and active communities


on Facebook. On top of that, you get the


school community building training. So,


yeah, if you actually type in school


here, you get tons of training on how


I've built communities with school if


you want to learn this stuff yourself as


you can see. And then I'll basically


show you how I built and scaled multiple


thriving communities on school. So, like


the setup, the structure, the


engagement, tactics, and everything


else. On top of that, you're going to


get the 100 M AI content machine. So,


this is where you can take one single


idea and turn it into over a 100 pieces


of content across every single platform.


So, you've probably seen me on X, maybe


you've seen me on Instagram, maybe on


Facebook ads, maybe on LinkedIn, on


YouTube, on multiple different channels


on YouTube, etc. Basically, this machine


here shows you exactly how to do it. Um,


and how to save over 20 hours per week


doing this, right? And then you also get


the high ticket service delivery


formula. So this is the process I've


used to scale AI automation services to


clients. You get all my frameworks,


delivery systems, communication


templates, etc. inside the air profit


boardroom. You also get the AI avatar


content system. So you're going to learn


how to build AI avatars to create


content for you that sound like you and


post for you. So for example, if you


have a look at my YouTube channel, these


videos are all like AI avatar videos


that get thousands of views. They reach


millions of people and um and we've


automated we've got a great system for


automating this stuff, right? What else


we got here? So you also get the school


empire system. So this shows you how I


built school communities with AI, all


the funnels I build, etc. The Twitter


growth system as well. So if you've seen


me on Twitter, for example, you've


probably seen my AI content. We reach


again millions of people per month on X


and uh we're constantly publishing


content which is automated with AI. You


get all those systems inside the profit


port 2. And then also you get the AI


workflow vault. So you get access to


over 1,000 pre-built NA10 automations.


You get daily Q&A with me. So you can


ask me anything about AI automation or


building your business. And you know if


it's something complicated I actually


create a video and help you with the


answer. Top of that you get unlimited


tech support. So you get unlimited tech


support where you can get help with any


issues inside the A prof. You can just


create a thread get fast answers etc. So


if you have a look here for example


people are posting um and asking for


help and stuff like that. For example


like Steve he actually set up a new


YouTube channel with AI and reached over


200,000 people which is pretty crazy.


You see all these different posts that


people are creating


and sharing and then they get help and


support from our community. All right.


You also get week uh weekly coaching


calls. So you get weekly coaching calls


where you can show up, ask questions,


get feedback and watch me work through


problems in real time along with my


team. We'll help you during those live


calls. We have a bunch of giveaways and


that's everything you get, right? So,


you get the AI automation blueprint, the


Facebook growth training, the school


community system, the 100M content


machine, the service delivery formula,


the AI avatar system, the school empire


training, the Twitter growth system,


over 1,000 pre-built workflows, daily


Q&A with me, unlimited tech support, and


five live coaching course a week, plus


monthly giveaways, and um if you sign up


now on their Black Friday deal, which is


only available for a few more hours,


then you will save 35% forever, right?


So you sign up to that price now and


then you lock in your 35% discount


forever by signing up here. You just


sign up to the aircraft boardroom link


in the comments in description to get


that. So it's an absolute steal right


now. What we got here? Yeah, let's keep


going through now. So if we go back to


anti-gravity here,


we've plugged in the details of our


landing page that we want to create.


Then we said create better, more modern


version of the landing page. Blah blah


blah direct all the traffic here. This


is the URL. And uh if we click on view,


we can see the landing page and we can


see the AI scrolling through it. Right


now that landing page looks so much


nicer than the original. If you want to


actually open it up, you can open it up


inside the Aentic browser which you can


see. All right. So this is the example


page. If we scroll up, it's got the it's


it's got the details here. So it looks


super nice. It gives us a code to use.


If we click on this link, it should take


us to the checkout page. By the way,


this is a real deal, right? So, if you


actually want help with AICO, feel free


to order online. Link in the comments


description. But yeah, we you can order


online. We've got a huge Black Friday


deal right now for 30% off. So, if you


type in Black Friday on the checkout


page, you will save 30% when you order


here. And then you can use uh select


whichever package you want. So, you can


select like backlinks here. So, you can


say, "Right, okay, I want five or seven


backlinks for my website." Apply the


code and then boom, you can get access.


This is way way cheaper than uh our


normal agency service as well cuz you


order in online. And then you can also


select multiple packages. So you could


go with the SEO starter package, the SEO


power pack or the premium pack as well.


And then you just fill in your details


here and you can pay online. So if we


have a look at this page, this looks a


lot nicer than the original. So if we go


back to let me show you what the


original look like. So if we open up


this is the original page with the


YouTube video, the headline, etc. It


looks okay, but it's a little bit messy


when it comes to the design and


everything else, right? Whereas, if we


have a look at the new design, this is


the new version. It looks a lot nicer,


right? Everything's aligned, it's all


cleaned up, it's all tidy, etc. Yeah,


it's looking really good that. And then


you can actually insert a demo video


here. It just looks a lot cleaner,


right? And I think that demonstrates a


lot more trust. It's taken exactly the


same copy, but it's just redesigned it


with our brand colors. It's even, for


example, it's even included like some of


the benefits that I didn't mention


previously. Got the limited time offer,


testimonials, and then the CTAs. I would


say that's a much nicer design page,


especially this section right here. It


looks super nice. Let's try and preview


it on mobile if we can. Can we preview


on mobile? We can change the device


here. Yeah, there we go. So, this is the


version on mobile here. And then we can


scroll down. It's It's not looking as


good on on mobile to be honest with you,


but we've redesigned the whole page


there. So, it's pretty simple and easy


to do this. Sper says that's a pretty


well done site from one single prompt.


Yeah, I agree with you there. I think


that looks pretty nice. So, yeah, you


can build websites pretty quickly. I


mean, like building websites used to be


a nightmare, whereas uh now you can


easily just create them in one single


prompt like I've shown you today and uh


you type in simple words, whatever you


want, and it just fix things. I used to


spend like hours fixing this sort of


stuff, and you know, you get buses that


break, layouts look weird, code that


makes no sense, etc. But with


anti-gravity, that saves a lot of time.


It's way faster. And again, like some


people say, "I'm not good at coding, but


Antiggravity basically writes a code for


you." Some people say websites look too


complex, but anti-gravity basically


explains it to you like a teacher if you


ask it. And yeah, it's it's super fast


and easy to do. Now, I think you could


really use this for SEO as well to


create like micro sites. So, you can


see, for example, this is a website


where we're publishing content


consistently. We have multiple different


websites we're doing this on like airoft


boarding this world. You can see some


examples of of the traffic we get to


this website. So within the last um 3


months you can see we get thousands of


clicks here. But basically


we could use this and and then create


content across multiple different


platforms. I want to find another


example here. Yeah. So this is another


website as well. But I think you could


really leverage anti-gravity to create


micro sites for you. So what you can


actually do if you wanted to use Google


anti-gravity for SEO is you could go to


press find some keywords where you can


build little micro sites around. So for


example, let's say I don't know SEO


training or something like that, right?


And you can create a little micro site


based on like some low competition


keywords. So if we have a look here,


we're going to type in like KD10 LS.


See what we got. Maybe KD 20s. Let's


have a look here. See what we can create


content. All right. Select enterprise


SEO ROI calculator and that's actually


that's a website that I own and vibe


coded with AI, right? So if we click on


book a free strategy session, it funnels


traffic to our book a call page, right?


And it's ranking number one for that


keyword. So if we go on to Google here,


you can see us ranking number one even


after we coded it like about a year ago.


Let's open this up in a new incognito


just to make sure. Yes, you can see us


ranking number one for that keyword,


right? And the way that we did this and


vibe coded out, so we actually used bold


previously, but basically what you want


to do is just find low competition


keywords, right? So ideally like keyword


difficulty 10 or less. You can find a


bunch of micro site ideas here. So for


example, like SEO, like calculator,


whatever your niche is, just type in


your niche and then calculator. So I


have an SEO agency, so that's why I'm


doing SEO. And then from here, we can


pick out different keywords we want to


rank for. So for example, SEO cost


calculator tool. Right now, what we can


do is we can go back over to


anti-gravity. We can start up a new


project. So, I'm going to click on new


window here. We'll close the old one.


So, I'm going to X off the old one here.


Click on open folder. New folder. Type


in the keyword of the micro site. I'm


going to create SEO cost calculator


tool. Hit open. Then from here, what we


can do is we can say okay, create a


beautiful landing page website


modern etc. optimized for the keyword


uh keywords, right? And then we're going


to say funnel traffic to


my SEO agency booker call page here,


right? And then right out of the landing


page, copy


selling SEO services


as gold agency


and following traffic to book a call.


That's right. And then what you can


actually do is put in your brand colors


as well. So I'm going to just write that


there. There's our brand colors. So put


brand colors here. We go. Hit enter. And


then we can just vibe code out a landing


page or micro site pretty quickly. V


code that out, host it on net file


wherever you want. Code it out locally


and then start ranking on on Google.


Pretty simple and easy. So if if you're


wondering, okay, like can you find easy


keywords to rank for using this?


Absolutely. I've shown you even in the


SEO industry which is a pretty difficult


niche to rank in. You can see how easy


it was for me to find low competition


keywords so we can create a rank. Can we


actually rank on Google for those target


keywords? Absolutely. So this is a page


that we created a year ago. It's a


calculator ranking for that keyword. It


funnels traffic to my funnels here. And


uh it's really easy to build out these


SEO sites using anti-gravity. It's even


outranking for example HFS or even my


main website. So it's outranking


Julianolder.com. is outranking HRES,


which is a super powerful website. And


uh we've done it using this process


here, right? Pretty simple and easy. And


it gets like 4,000 impressions. Doesn't


get a lot of clicks, but you can see how


it works. And then if you want to


actually code this out, you can use


anti-gravity. How would you do it? You


use a prompt like this. If you want to


get that prompt, I'll put it inside the


AR profit boardroom. So, let me go


inside here. Example prompt for


websites. Let me There we go. Hit save.


Boom. So, if we go back to anti-gravity,


that's coding out here. And now it's


just working on building that out step


by step. Might take a few minutes as


we've seen today, but it's it's pretty


easy. You could also use Bolt, you could


use Love Wall, etc. I'm just going to


close this one down. There we go. We're


using Claude Sonic again cuz those


limits have been hit on Gemini 3. So, we


can't use Gemini 3 Pro for like 4 hours.


So, just be aware that you can hit


limits pretty quickly. And actually, if


I was doing this all over again, I'd


probably start with planning mode. So


switch to planning mode inside


anti-gravity first and then you can use


fast mode later for anti-gravity. And


then sporter says low competition


keywords. You would only pick one per


micro site. Absolutely. Right. So if you


go back now for example like here right


here you would just pick one of these


keywords. So you're not going to try and


rank for SEO ROI calculator and


enterprise SER calculator. You would


only pick one right and inside the URL


you want it to be exact match. So for


example, if we're targeting this keyword


enterprise SEO calculator, then inside


the domain, we're going to put that


domain.com,


right? So that we can start ranking for


it. And then you just want to make sure


as well you can monetize this. So for


example, if I have an SEO agency, I'm


going to rank for SEO keywords. Uh


because typically people are searching


for SEO problems on Google need help


with SEO. So, it's now building this out


and uh we should get that back in a


second. It's creating the index html


here. So, you can preview the code on


this side and you can see the files on


the left hand side. I also like the fact


that it's just so clean and easy to use


this stuff


which is pretty nice. And then you can


also reveal in Finder, right? So if you


want to find this inside your your


finder and um and just see the actual


file itself, you just go to review and


finder. You can also copy the relative


path. You can reopen the editor as well.


Yeah, that's basically how it works. And


then it's coding out


right as you can see here. So I think


what it will do next is code there CSS.


We'll see how that goes.


And then the other thing you want to do


here as well is like with this website


we have a look at this site that's


ranking number one for this keyword


right we want to put the URL into hrefs


and um you can see that we've built 33


back links to this page right so you can


see the organic traffic for this page


here organic traffic has grown as we


build more backlinks to it right how do


we build back links to it we just build


back links from there there's actually a


few like automated websites here so I'm


just going to go with one link per


domain do follow show results there we


go right so what we do is we find


relevant pieces of content and we link


that to the website. Right? So from here


to here. And if you're wondering, okay,


what a backlinks, what do they look


like, etc. So you can see that's an


example of a backlink, it's just a


clickable text from one website to


another. We've built it from our site


that powers up our site. Pretty simple


and easy. And the more backlinks you


have from relevant authority sources. So


this is a website about SEO. We've built


links to this page about SEO, the the


more power that website has. So for


example, from Julian.com, from


Julian.co.uk, DK with link directly to


this ROI calculator page, right? Pretty


simple. That's the way that I like to


look at SEO as well. It's just like, you


know, make it as simple as possible. So,


I'm going to say, okay, is this still


coding out? It seems to have got stuck.


I'm going to say preview this now. See


if we can preview it out. What else we


got here? All right. So, basically, this


has got to create the CSS first. So, if


we go back


to anti-gravity here, it's still got to


create the CSS. And again, the quality


of the CSS, the quality of the website


itself will depend on the API you use.


So, Claude 4.5 Sonic, I would expect the


API to be pretty nice for coding, but GP


OSS, I think you're not going to get the


best results from that to be honest. You


can also see there's an update available


for this. So, if you restart to update,


you can get that access right there. But


yeah, that's basically how it works,


right? I'm not going to wait forever for


that to code, but you can see how easy


this is to do. And then from here, if


you wanted to host this stuff, what


you're going to do is just open up the


folder you want to host it on. So, for


example, like Julian Cordi website, as


you can see, right? This is a page with


VIP coded out little micro site again.


And you would just go over to Netlify


login. I might have to log in with


GitHub to be honest. There we go. And


then we've just I've just got a


verification code in the background.


And then once you're logged in to


Netlefi, you can just upload your


project files. Right? So for example,


Julian Golden Automation. This is a


website we uploaded earlier. You can see


the page right here. And the way this


works is you would just go to


projects, add new project, import an


existing project, try netifi drop, and


then grab the folder from locally that


anti-gravity is coded out, right? And so


for example, like this,


we've got the folder right here. And you


just grab that folder and plug it into


Netlifi, right? So you just grab that


folder and then you can drop it in


like that. Yeah. And that's going to


upload your SEO calculator, whatever you


created, and then deploy it online,


right? Pretty simple and easy. So that's


how it works, peeps. That's how you can


use uh Netify. MD says, "If you want,


you can reach millions of people your


videos through YouTube. Why don't you do


it?" I already do. So maybe you probably


haven't seen my analytics obviously, but


like if you check out my analytics, you


can see just in the last year, we


reached 25 million people


through YouTube. So we reach a lot of


people on YouTube. We reach millions of


people. All right, so that's basically


how you can use this stuff. Um, if you


want to get help with SEO,


check out the Black Friday deal that we

of course, and uh it's pretty simple and


easy to order online. But yeah, the main


thing I would say here is like, you


know, a lot of people watching this,


they've probably got a website, but


they're not getting traffic, right? And


so, if you're if you're if you've got a


website and you know, you're being


outranked by your competitors who are


sitting at the top of Google getting all


the clicks, all the attention, etc., all


the new customers, and you're wondering,


okay, what do they know that you don't?


Well, that basically ends today, right?


because I'm showing you the SEO

the SEO frameworks that that work for


me. And I've already shown you multiple

then how can we implement it for your


business as well. So you can order

All right, so let's see what else we've


got on the comments here. Any tips on


how to keep your computer performance


working whilst you run all your AI


software. Yeah, just keep it minimal.


Close as much as you can. I'm using a


MacBook M4 that seems to work pretty


well with the MacBook Pro, but yeah, I


just I would close multiple windows.


Just keep it all minimal. I'm actually


going to close Google Anti-gravity now.


And yeah, I I would just avoid like


using too much. And then also if you're


really struggling with coding locally,


then just switch to coding online


instead to use a cloud. So for example,


Bolt, Loveable, these tools work online


and they don't require any sort of


firepower from you and your laptop.


Majority of business owners and people


at large have no idea how easy this is


and how good this technology is right


now. Yeah, that's why we created the


profit boarding because a lot of people


want to use AI. They want to learn it,


but they have no idea where to start.


they feel intimidated by the power of


it, right? And so that's why we broke


everything down into simple systems that


work for me. So I test everything and


then I release the systems online so


people can just steal the process from


me. And yeah, that's basically it. So


thanks very much everyone for watching.


Appreciate as always. Like I said, check


out the SEO Black Friday deal. And then


we have a deal for AI profit boardroom


as well. So you can save 35% off


forever. You get uh weekly coaching


calls. You can jump on this course live,


ask help, ask for advice, etc. Yeah, all


of my best playbooks for AI and all the


best systems that we have and just an


awesome community of 1,700 members where


you can ask help, get advice, ask


questions, and I answer this stuff


personally for you as well. So, feel


free to get that link in the comments in


description. What else we got here? Mulo


says, "Do you think Grock 4.1 will prove


superior to Gemini 3 over the long run?"


I actually don't. I tested out Grock


4.1. I just thought this is one of the


worst things ever used. Like, it was


just it was so bad. It was so bad. I


think Gemini wins by a long way and and


Gemini is just superior to everything


right now. Same with Nano Banana. Nano


Banana is superior. Beer 3 is superior.


Like Google just created the best


technologies in the world for all this


stuff. Okay, so Google just released


something called anti-gravity IDE. They


just launched the public preview on


November 18th, 2025. And developers are


losing their minds over this. Here's why


this matters. Every other AI coding tool


you've used, they help you write code.


They suggest things. But anti-gravity,


it actually does the work for you. Like


actually does it from start to finish.


So anti-gravity is what Google calls an


agent first IDA. That means AI agents


are not just helpers. They're the main


thing. These agents are powered by


Gemini 3 Pro. That's Google's latest and


most powerful AI model. But here's


what's really cool. You're not locked


into just Google's model. Anti-gravity


also supports Claude Sonnet 4.5 from


Anthropic and GPOSS,


which is an open-source model. Now,


there are two main parts to


anti-gravity. The editor view and the


manager view. The editor view looks like


VS Code. You've got your code editor,


aside panel. Natural language tasks.


Pretty normal so far. But the manager


view, this is mission control for your


AI agents. You can spawn multiple


agents, watch them work, see what each


one is doing all at the same time. It's


like having a whole team of developers


working for you. Okay, so what can these


agents actually do? This is the part


that blew my mind. These agents have


access to three things. The code editor,


the terminal, and a web browser. So,


imagine this. You tell an agent to build


a login form. The agent writes the code,


opens the terminal, runs the dev server,


opens a browser, actually clicks through


your login form, takes screenshots, and


verifies everything works all by itself.


And it doesn't just do one thing at a


time. You can have multiple agents


running in parallel. One agent building


the UI, another agent writing tests,


another agent fixing bugs, all working


together like a real development team.


Now, you might be thinking, okay, this


sounds cool, but how do I know what the


AI is actually doing? This is where


artifacts come in. Every time an agent


does something, it creates artifacts,


task lists, implementation plans,


screenshots, browser recordings,


everything is documented. So, you can


see exactly what the agent planned,


exactly what it built. Nothing is


hidden. And here's the best part. You


can leave comments on these artifacts


just like Google Docs. So if the agent's


plan looks wrong, you can comment on it


and the agent will adjust. You're


collaborating with the agent. But wait,


it gets even better. These agents have


memory. They remember past tasks. They


remember code snippets you've used


before. They remember your feedback and


they get better over time. So if you ask


an agent to do something similar to what


you did last week, it already knows your


style. It just does it better and


faster. Real quick before we keep going,


if you want to scale your business and


get more customers, you need to check


out my AI profit boardroom. This is the


best place to learn how to use AI


strategies and connect with a community


of people doing the exact same thing.


The link is in the description. Okay,


back to anti-gravity. So, how do you


actually use this thing? First, you


download anti-gravity. It works on


Windows, Mac, and Linux. You need at


least 8 gigs of RAM, but 16 is better.


Then, you start a new agent. You give it


a task. in plain English, something like


build me a simple to-do app. The agent


breaks it down into steps, writes the


code, opens the terminal, launches a dev


server, opens a browser, tests


everything, takes screenshots, and gives


you a full report. You can watch all of


this happen in real time. Or you can go


do something else and check back later.


You can even spawn multiple agents for


bigger projects. One agent does


research, another writes code, another


handles testing. It's like being a CEO


of a dev team, except all your


developers are AI agents. So, how does


this compare to other AI coding tools


like Cursor? Here's the thing. Cursor is


great for code completion. It helps you


write faster, but it doesn't have this


multi- aent mission control thing. With


anti-gravity, the agents actually do the


work. They don't just suggest, they


execute, they plan, they verify, they


work in parallel. That's a huge


difference. Now, don't get me wrong,


anti-gravity isn't perfect. It's still


in public preview. There are bugs. Some


people report crashes. There are rate


limits. And you really need to use git


because if something goes wrong, you


might lose your work. Some Mac users are


having login issues and some people hit


the rate limits pretty fast, especially


on big projects. Google says the limits


refresh every 5 hours. But if you're


doing heavy work, you might run into


them. But here's the thing. This is


brand new. It just launched. These


issues will get fixed. And even with


these bugs, the potential here is


massive. Let me tell you why this is


such a big deal. We're moving from AI


that helps developers to AI that is


developers. Right now, if you want to


build something, you write the code.


Artificial intelligence helps you go


faster, but you're still doing the work.


With anti-gravity, you're managing


agents. You're coordinating work. You're


reviewing results, but the agents are


doing the actual building. And the


browser integration is huge. These


agents can actually see your app. They


can click buttons. They can fill out


forms. They can take screenshots and


verify things work. That's not something


most AI tools can do. Plus, the artifact


system means you're not flying blind.


You see everything. You understand


what's happening. And the multi- aent


setup means you can tackle way bigger


projects. So, where is this going? I


think we're going to see more models


added, more integrations, better memory


systems, more powerful automation. And


here's what I think is really going to


happen. The role of a developer is going


to change. Instead of writing every line


of code, you're going to be managing AI


agents, reviewing their work, setting


direction. the boring, repetitive stuff.


The agents handle that. This frees you


up to focus on the creative parts, the


architecture, the big decisions, the


user experience, and honestly, that's


way more fun. Anyway, now I want to be


real with you for a second. Version


control is not optional anymore. You


need to use Git. You need backups


because if an agent messes something up,


you want to be able to roll back second.


You still need to understand code. You


can't just blindly trust what the agents


do. You need to review. You need to


verify. The agents are tools. They're


not magic. Third, this is a public


preview. That means it's not finished.


There will be bugs. Don't use this for


missionritical production stuff yet. But


even with all that, this is still


incredible and it's only going to get


better from here. Look, the bottom line


is this. Anti-gravity IDE is a big deal.


It's not perfect. It's not finished. But


it's showing us where we're going. And


where we're going is a world where AI


agents do the heavy lifting and


developers focus on the important stuff.


Is it going to replace developers? No.


But it's going to change what being a


developer means. Because the future


isn't about writing more code, it's


about building better things faster. So,


should you try anti-gravity? If you're


curious about AI and coding, absolutely


download it, play with it, see what it


can do. Just remember to use version


control, and don't trust it blindly. And


look, this is just the beginning. Google


is going to keep improving this. Other


companies are going to build competing


tools. This whole space is exploding


right now, and I'm going to keep


covering it. Right? Before you go, I
