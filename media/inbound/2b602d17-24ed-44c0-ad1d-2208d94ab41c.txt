today we are going to be running through


complexity aiso with a Twist because we


have a member from the SEO Elite Circle


today Dino welcome Dino thank you Julian


uh good to be here good to have you on


it you know this the first time we've


done a live stream with an seite Circle


member so it's super exciting I know


you're in the plumbing na so you talking


about real estate as well for your


partner so I it's gonna be fun to just


run through some live examples of how


you can use perplexity for that yeah


perfect yeah can you do um yeah can you


get stuck in absolutely all right cool


so what we're going to do is I'll share


my screen are you using like AI for your


website the


minute um yes content


yes yeah okay makes sense and and and


articles yeah how do you typically write


your your content right now using like


AI or what sort of AI you using yes I am


using AI I use um on page


AI um and that does uh like page


optimization and for your articles which


is really cool nice yeah like what I've


never used on page I AI like what sort


of stuff do you do with that um


basically you just yeah write in your uh


keyword you're going for and it'll write


your article in you know a few minutes


and you're done pretty much and it


optimizes it um with all the Google


entities and all that sort of stuff so


yeah it's really good that's pretty cool


that's pretty cool all right I'm just


going to quickly sign up to perplexity


Pro and upgrade my membership just so I


can show people watching like all the


cool stuff you can do it now first thing


I would say for you like obviously


you're in the plumbing Niche and you're


trying to rank locally right so you're


in Harvey Bay for example yep yeah so


the one of the best ways you can use


perplex is like you can actually just


come up with a bunch of like local SEO


keywords around your particular Niche so


for example let's say and I put


everything all the prompts and


everything from today and I'll share


them with you but I also share them with


everyone watching as well but like


example yeah so let's say your Niche is


um plumbers Harvey Bay right oh yeah h e


r v e


y h r v yep a a y right you say h e r v


y e okay perfect that's it all right all


the way from Australia


and uh we're going International today


so Nish equals Plum Harvey Bay and then


you can say right uh find me


some low competition


keywords alphabet suit


method to generate


customers for my local business right


and anyone watching this like you don't


have to necessarily use uh you don't


have to use this for local like you can


use this for for any sort of Industry


you want


right and


so you could switch this to for example


like you could Niche this down to like


e-commerce real estate info products


whatever Niche you're in this prompt


will work if you customize it right okay


and then you can see a bunch of ideas


right here now some of these are going


to be BS and some of them you're


probably not going to want to use right


but for example best emergency plumber


Harvey Bay that looks like a relevant


keyword to me that you could potentially


rank for the other thing that you can do


yeah is you can go into Google water to


complete if you need some keyword


ideas and you can just have a look


through the list and be like okay Harvey


Bay plumbers Harvey Bay Plumbing these


two will likely be the same page yeah


because people are basically looking for


the same thing but then you can also see


for example you got hary Bay Plumbing


Supplies hary Bay plumbing jobs um that


probably wouldn't be so relevant to you


yeah and


also like I think for you particularly


emergency PL would be pretty good


because like those are customers ready


to buy and also ready to spend a lot


money at the same time


right yeah


awesome I don't know why but you know my


uh I've got a lot of cousins back in


England but they're all going to


Australia at the


minute perfect weather here at the


moment it's great yeah they they love it


also like a mate I grew up with as well


he over to to Perth actually oh yeah


yeah yeah yeah so I don't know what


happens you let people go home after


they go or they


don't they love it too much yeah so they


stay


yeah all right cool we got a lot of


people watching as well so Tyler says


howdy guys hi Tyler is another member of


the SE Elite so welcome Tyler Ami says


hi Julian and you know if we've got any


questions as we going along we got a lot


of people watching today if anyone has


any questions as we go along just feel


free to ask them and we'll just help you


out as much as we can right so


essentially for you um Dina what I would


say is like when you're doing the


keyword research and when you find some


good examples of keywords you like just


build up a list of like 50 of


them yeah and then you know like yeah


this is all my this is all my keyword


research and then it's just a case of of


creating the content from there do you


have like a keyword strategy in place at


the minute


um sort of like when I first did it


obviously I use RFS um as well following


what you were doing um which is awesome


love RFS it's great um the thing I


didn't do at the start was I didn't have


like longtail keywords for a lot of blog


posts so I was just like plumbers Harvey


Bay I was just basically doing my


suburbs so like plumbers Harvey Bay


plumbers urangan um you know blah blah


blah and creating Pages for that for my


local search um I guess the thing for me


was structuring um how you do the like


the blogs with with finding these


keywords I


guess all right so like you want to know


how to structure your blogs right yeah


for SEO okay we'll come on to that in a


second and we have a question from guy


who says hi I want quality back links


can you help absolutely if you book in a


call Link in the comments description


you can book in a call about link


building and you know feel free to jump


on a call with us one for one we'll


guide you through number one how to


build back links the best types of links


to build and then also if you want us to


do it for you we're happy to do that too


so let's keep running through now and uh


yeah so from here I hope that everyone


watching like it's it's


pretty it's pretty clear how to do the


the keyword research Dino I know you


were saying you were following the


structure from the SE Elite Circle which


is a really good way to do it and then


also the thing for you as well I would


say is like there's going to be certain


Niche services that you offer around


Plumbing that you could also rank for


that would be quite easy uh so for


example like I don't know if you do this


but you know for example services like


drain cleaning gas fitting Hot Water


Systems Etc yeah yeah yeah definitely


and then yeah with those you just you


create a page on your website for them


they're not a Blog are they is that


correct yeah exactly so like these would


be more service Pages not blocks yeah so


for


example we'll go on to to Google now


I'll show you some examples of how to do


this so there's a few ways you can do it


um


let me type in some example keywords so


for example Plum this Harvey


Bay let's say you're trying to WR for


the keyword best plumbers Harvey Bay


right there's a few ways you can


structure this I mean the first thing I


would say is number one get a Maps list


in if you haven't already yeah I have


I've just recently done all that so I


think my website's been live for like a


couple of weeks um


yeah perfect and then also when you're


doing the the local Maps listing like


you want to make sure that you you get a


lot of reviews on there like you can see


how this is ordered in terms of reviews


like 576 13 118 yeah it's like the best


reviews and the most amount of reviews


for the maps listings that the rank


that's say the 820 of it yeah yeah also


we had a really good thread inside the


SE Elite Circle I pull this up as a


freebie for everyone watching but I


think it'd be super super useful for you


as well Dean yeah S I haven't seen that


yet yeah where is it now


let me try and find this example for


you here we go right I'm actually going


to I'll pin it to the feed because I


think a lot of people in the the SEO


Community would like it right but yeah


cool basically um yeah so reviews are


like the 820 it obviously I in like lots


of images and videos to the content


well CTR with driving directions was


another tip reced by Ronald Osborne he


actually he's in Australia too he he's a


member of the SE Circle makes about 150k


a month with Partnerships and uh yeah


these are some of his best tips as well


and then also just align the I think a


lot of people do this wrong but like


align the gmbb with your services on the


website if that makes


sense yeah yeah


cool yeah and uh you've also seen the


full training here right on on how to do


SEO I think that help you too yeah I did


watch that this morning that was really


good so yeah I just need to put that


into practice now Perfect all right I'm


going to copy and paste these tips into


this document for you just so that


you've got them you know how to handle


it great all right we've covered a lot


already how to automate keyword research


how to find examples and some of the


best examples for you how to do gmbs


next up let's talk about how to


structure your blogs for are you using


any sort of like content outline tool to


figure out what sort of keywords you can


rank for


um basically I just I was just going


into Google and typing a certain keyword


and then um yeah coming up with you know


um best plumbers Harvey Bay um plumbers


Harvey Bay prices all that sort of stuff


for that that's all I was using at this


point yeah okay so here's how I usually


do when it comes to figuring out what I


should rank for so let's say for example


I want to rank for the keyword best


Plumb is har Bay inside the organic


listings so be below the the maps


listings right if I want to rank for a


keyword like that I'm going to be


looking at all these competitors I'm not


going to put it up on this example video


because you know obviously it's other


people's content I don't want to show


that on the YouTube video but yeah you


can basically look through other


people's


Pages get a list of all the


headings get a list of all the the


topics and FAQs have covered and the


structure and the word account


and then reverse engineer okay this is


what's working for them therefore I'm


going to do it for my site too if that


makes sense yeah cool yeah so like


reverse


engineer your competitors I'm sure you


wouldn't as well but don't just like


steal the headings but like re it you


need yeah cool yeah perfect all right


there's a couple other options to help


you I'm going to show you some some good


examples of how to do this


so if you want to automate your outlines


but you want to automate them for cheap


let's say you don't want to look through


every single competitor over and over


again right you don't want to do that


all manually yourself what you can do is


you can go inside appsumo and you can


search something like


phrase and uh and just try and find some


alternatives to phrase that that would


automate your content outlines otherwise


you can type in stuff like content


outlines and basically appsumo it gives


you access to tools that are like


heavily discounted sort of copies of


other competitors if that makes sense


cool


yeah so if we're scrolling through


here uh you know you've got like


witnessed uh sorry right seed right seed


is only $44 and you see how it's giving


you a Content optimization score here


yeah that looks very very similar to


like phrase or Surfer or all these


optimization tools that will automate


the content outl for you yeah yeah well


that's what um yeah that on page AI does


too


basically same sort of thing which is


awesome yeah yeah that's exactly what


you want definitely that sounds good I


me I'm going to have to do a video on on


page AI yeah it's really good yeah all


right it and then like um you know


obviously it's got all your Google


entities on the right um and then it'll


add them into the content and then you


can basically just click on the words


that it's missing and then it'll Auto


optimize um it does AI detection um yeah


it does everything it's really


good right I'm going to have to put that


on my list of video ideas


let me find it right


here on page AI perfect yeah all right I


think there's there's two but it's the


one with like the little rocket


ship oh okay yeah I mean if it's got the


rocket ship emoji I'm I'm already bought


in mate a sure thing know me too


well all right cool um we got a few


questions here that I want to just


answer on the the comments here so


novice says you recommend writing


articles about about all the related


keywords at the main topic I'll show you


how to automate this in a second and the


best way to figure out okay what should


you write in your article and how to


optimize it and then Tyler says if the


first position is a product page but I


want to do a Blog Page is it a wise idea


or should I also do a product page that


rank them yeah so if for example Google


was showing like 10 product pages or


five product pages for that keyword you


would also do a product page for that


keyword same as Deno was saying before


like if you're trying to rank for best


emergency plumber Harvey Bay then you


would create a service page around that


topic because it's obviously not a blog


post that people are looking for right


yeah that was the one thing that really


me um you know what's a Blog what's a


what's a page sort of


thing yeah that makes sense and then


also um guy says I don't believe in AI


for keyword research now you can believe


what you want but I would say number one


perplexity gives you some solid ideas


but then you want to vet them right you


want to go through this list and make


sure people are actually searching for


them but also so Auto the autocomplete


in Google is basically AI like the the


ideas that you're getting from Google's


autocomplete it's basically like AI


generated stuff right so they're kind of


like predicting based on previous data


what people search for in the future and


also if you're not sure about some of


these keywords let's say for example


you're not sure okay can I rank for for


best plumbers Harvey Bay you can


actually validate them so you can take a


keyword like this and be like that


sounds like BS to me I don't believe AI


or I don't believe Google a to complete


let me check it for myself so you can go


into H's free qword tool and then from


here free keyword generate tool and just


paste in that keyword that you found


previously hit find


keywords make sure you verify you're a


human and if you can't find that keyword


then you know potentially you don't want


to rank for it but usually if it's like


a local keyword and it is in the aut


complete then that's a good sign um also


what you can do is you can just put in a


shortened version of it so you can put


best you can put plumbers jav Bay make


sure you set the the country as well so


I think that's why I didn't show up


before just make sure you set up the


country hit find


keywords verify it and you can see this


is a pretty easy keyword to rank for the


volume is higher than 100 for that


search keyword so it's a good one to go


for you know yeah


100% all right let's finally come on to


the content creation and how to do this


so when you're using any of these tools


we'll create new we'll type in that


keyword we were going after before so


best PL is Harvey Bay we'll set the the


country as


Australia and then we'll hit create


document now is there anything I know


you're saying like you weren't sure what


to write about inside the content is


that because on page AI is not giving


you the information that you need or


you're just not sure about certain


things no so it like once you got the


keyword it writes everything for you


which is great it was just basically


like how I was structuring like


obviously plumbers Harvey Bay plumbers


urangan which is a suburb was like a


page but then um you know like best


plumbers Harvey Bay did I have a do I


structure a page for that or is that a


Blog um ah I see yeah that was yeah that


was a sort of thing like what was a page


and what was a was a Blog


basically yeah so in that example right


let's have a look at best Plum Harvey


Bay


if we pull up this example and we scroll


down and see what's ranking you can see


these the keywords a lot of the pages


that are ranking are number one


directories so you can see for example


this is like top 10 plumbers in javey


Bay yeah that's a directory this is a


homepage so you can't really reverse


engineer a homepage like that's just


that's just a company this is a


directory let me have a look at this


example right here


this is like a a service page


yeah and let's have a look at this one


this is like a service page as well it's


a homepage but it's basically a service


page right so if I was looking at the


first page of Google there um I think


for you because you're not a rank and


rent website just create a service page


yeah okay cool that be the main thing so


so not a blog post but an actual service


page Yeah so basically yeah find the


words type them into Google see what


they're showing up for if they're a blog


or or a page and then just copy what


they're showing up as yeah 100% And then


also like when you're doing the content


outline whatever tool you're using let


me zoom in for people right here so they


can see it but whatever tool you using


you can choose to select headings from


search results like so and it will give


you a list of like the headings from you


comped so for example you can look


through the list and you're like right


okay I'm going to take I'm going to take


some of the these scroll through them


and just add them to the list so like


plumbus Harvey Bay We'll add that and


you see how it's called like H1 H2 Etc


yeah yeah so that's kind of like the


hierarchy of a page so like you start


off with a H1 then H2 H3


Etc yeah cool yeah and then you can run


through like these headings and just


answer the content now what you're also


going to see is on the page you'll see


the word cam right so this is 5,300


words 1,800 words 1, 100 words 1,100


words


right and so like that gives you an idea


of how many words you would write so if


if for example the average of the first


page which in this example looks like


roughly I would say around like maybe


1,000 words 1,200 words yeah then you


can then you would Target a similar


amount of word count


but you want to write with less fluff


than you can bet this yeah straight to


the point yeah exactly and if you can


give more value are you than your


competitors in a lower word count than


your competitors I think you're always


going to win because people like it's


not about writing the the longest page I


I think it's about giving the most


amount of value and the least amount of


time possible if that makes sense yeah


yeah


cool Tyler is asking what tool is that


so this particular tool is Phase iio


which I got a I got a lifetime deal on


appsumo and it's paid for itself but


again I think you could use tools like


this one for example right seed it


probably very similar things like you


can see the the content grading right


there it's obviously reverse engineering


what's already ranking and it also kind


of looks a bit like Jasper in terms of


the the workflows but yeah that gives


you an idea of what you can use and how


to use


it so does that make sense in terms of


like how to structure the website and


how to write the content and everything


yeah definitely yeah that's good I guess


yeah for me it was yeah obviously the


keywords um how you structure all that


with um your service pages and pages on


your site and then you know what do you


do for your blogs and then yeah then I


can start ripping into that now yeah


exactly and then you got your keyword


which is basically just a H1 like your


your main keyword is going to be the H1


exact match and then you write your your


content underneath


now I was I was speaking to another SEO


Elite Circle member last night actually


Matias dios there's a there's an


interview coming soon but we were


talking about the best ways to leverage


AI to write content and it's like I


wouldn't recommend just going down like


the one click and then publishing


approach but you can get you can get AI


to like do 80 or 90% of the content and


then just just find a way to like make


your content unique and add something


new some type of new information to the


content that most people aren't doing


does that make sense yeah yeah for sure


there's always ways to like make it more


unique add something interesting in


there add some some interesting detail


that most people haven't done um but I


just I wouldn't recommend writing it


based on on what your competitiv are


doing I'd write something completely new


based on the head ins and the outline


that Google has to see yeah yeah perfect


cool yeah and then from there you can


just generate the content now coming


back to perplexity and how to write the


content I think is one of the best ways


to do this is is write it SE section by


section so for example let's say you've


got a a heading to write like blocked


drains Harvey


okay you can go into perplexity we can


switch to Pro I'm actually just going to


make sure that we're using Claude


because Claude is my favorite AI model


to use when writing content do you only


do you usually use like track GPT inside


on page AI or what s


of yeah Claude I use Claude yeah yeah


Claude is just so much just the best


they might as well re all


models so what I normally do is I go


I'll type in like so I'll go on to my on


page find out like all my words that I


need um Google entities then I'll put


them in a little spreadsheet and then


I'll put them into Claude and say hey I


need to write a a page about plumbers


Harvey Bay can you make sure all these


words are included then I'll put that


into the tool um and then yeah I just


make sure all the words are included and


then once it looks good I yeah then


paste it into the website nice man yeah


yeah that's that's a good way to do it


so if we go on to AI models inside perp


Plexi settings this is on the pro


version but you can change it to to CLA


3.5 Sonic and then inside


the inside per Plexi what I'm going to


do is I'm just going to give it a prompt


the basically tells it to only write


this section but also adapt it to your


business and your brand right so for


example if we take one of my favorite


prompts for writing content


which is this one right here we're going


to grab


that we're going to plug it into


perplexity and we're going to put the


heading as


equals block drains Harvey Bas so let's


say you writing the content for this


H2 and uh and then from there put for


Content gration do this easy to read


feels conversational UK grammar we'll


delete the internal linking


opportunities


uh we won't add the


FAQs we'll add subheadings and headings


keyword in the first line first


person and that should be good to go


right and


then what I would also recommend is you


just add some information about you so


right from this


perspective and then just as a a


placeholder obviously you would tailor


it to your brand but it' be like okay um


a local


plumbing company


called Doos


plumbers sell my


services subtly throughout content right


and then


also here because it's just one single


section we want it to be like maximum I


would say maximum 200 words maybe less


okay we'll hit enter like so and it's


probably not going to come out perfect


but it'll give us a starting point to


write the content I'm just going to past


this prompt right here for people who


are


watching yeah cool I definitely need to


have a look at that prompt


too yeah I mean these prompts always


changing right so like the way the


things are it's always changing um if


you look for example let's have a look


at that see how long that is


yes it's written about 200 words there


it's formatted it really


nicely um and you see how it's like you


know dealing with this we've seen it all


at our company blockchains are a pain


but here's how we help them here's a


culprate here's why you shouldn't ignore


it um and here's why you should use a


professional instead of trying to do it


yourself right and then it sells your


services Sly throughout the


content yeah that's awesome I like that


with a a nice little CTA there as well


now let's say you've got like 10 or 12


headings and it's just a page that needs


to be 1,000 or 1,200 words you could cut


this down you say right cut this down to


100 words um and also semantically


optimize it with lsis and entities for


the keyword


so once you do all this um with


perplexity do you run it through like an


AI um scanning tool just so Google


doesn't detect it's through


AI I usually don't simply because I


don't really I don't think Google cares


anymore like if


I yeah but it's like if Google is


already ranking AI content number


one yeah it clearly it clearly isn't is


n against AI content but I think it is


against AI spam and and like unedited AI


spam I also think that if you look for


example at humanized content you know


stuff that passes AI detector that is AI


written usually it just doesn't feel was


natural is when it first came out the


the prompt you know yeah so that's why


I'm not too fuss about it but it depends


on people's race tolerance right if if


you're running a billion dollar company


you probably want to be a lot more com a


lot more careful yeah yeah


but you can see here so again it sold


you throughout the content but it's a


lot shorter it gets straight to the


point but it's nicely formatted as well


yeah cool yeah yeah so I think that's


good that's good to I'm just G that


looks really good thanks I'm just gonna


grab this sap right here and


then inside the description from the


video


today I'll give people access to this so


let me go


to the live stream we'll put this in


description you want to get access to it


do know as well it's just inside the


description there yeah perfect yeah I'll


definitely have a look at that that's


cool awesome so I think um yeah I did


this before I come into the um Elite


circle like a lot of my content so I'll


definitely probably have to go back


through um and use that prompt and and


um yeah upgrade a lot of my content I


think awesome and Nissa says do you


recommend injecting facts from new and


reliable sources by letting the GPT to


read and analyze Source page yourself I


think the best way to insert facts still


is to do it manually but if you really


want to do it like automated with with


AI I still think perplexity is probably


one of the best places you do this you


can go to to focus over here then you


can go to academic and then from


academic or in fact not even if you're


in the plumbing Niche you don't need to


go academic but you can say like find me


some statistics plus references plus


case studies about Plumbing in Australia


so you just tailor it to your Niche and


your location


Etc hit enter like so it will do the


research for you and it can it's


connected to the internet so you can


find that sort of


stuff and uh once that's done you can


find a bunch of like external resources


and facts to include inside the the


content right so you can see all this


information and you got the sources for


each fact on the side there so if people


want to automate the facts that's one of


the easiest ways to do it


cool yeah just a couple more FAQs I


think artifact says you're recommended


to write with AI app clients actually


check the AI detection in the content so


if you're if you're writing for clients


like you got to be transparent with them


that you're using AI if you're not


telling them you're using Ai and and


then they check it and they're like mate


you're using AI they're going to be


they're going to be seriously annoyed


right you'd be annoyed right do you know


if someone did that yeah


I guess like just depends like what


prompts they're using and and how the


content comes out as well like you know


if you're just typing in um plumbers


Harvey Bay drain cleaning or something


and go straight into J uh chat gbt and


it comes out very um basic you know


you'd probably be a bit annoyed but you


know if it comes up like we had it in


there it's pretty um yeah looked pretty


good yeah man definitely that's it it's


all about the quality like like if you


go if you into chat GB and you're like


write an article on SEO it' be terrible


what comes out it's all about prompt


yeah definitely and uh novice says but


ad networks have started to reject AI


content which I actually disagree with I


think that um there are certain facts


around that if you actually join the SEO


Elite Circle there's some some cool


stuff inside there on how to get


approved quickly and catfish says but


you're assuming that the entities that


LM understands because it was training


the same entities gole recognizes you


better yeah so what you can also do if


you if you really want to be like fact


driven on inserting entities just go


to you can use the tool like like phrase


to actually find the lsis for you or


also inside sist sist is another good


option we go inside the content


Optimizer this is a free tool actually


for everyone using it's just not that


good for for Content


outlines so if we log in


here and we'll go to content Optimizer


and I'll show you some examples of how


you can use the the entities in LS


size so if we go to


edit wait for that to load and you've


got a bunch of lsis on the right that
