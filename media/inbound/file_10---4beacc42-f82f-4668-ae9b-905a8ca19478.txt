This is the video you've been waiting


for. I'm about to take you through the


greatest technology release of the last


50 years. Open Claw has taken the entire


world by storm. And for good reason. It


is a 247 super intelligent AI employee


that does work for you around the clock,


even when you sleep. The challenge is it


can be super complicated. And because of


that, 99% of people aren't getting the


full power out of this technology. If


you use it the right way, you can


completely change your workflows in


life. If you use it the wrong way, it's


just another chat GPTbot. In this video,


I will cover every single aspect of


OpenClaw. From how to install it to how


it works to security to use cases that


will change your life. Whether you're an


OpenClaw pro or have never touched a


computer in your entire life, you're


going to get something out of this


video. So, let's lock in and get into


it. So, as I said in the intro, we are


going to cover everything in Open Claw.


So, if you are an OpenClaw pro, I highly


encourage you to skip around in the


chapters down below. There's going to be


something relevant to you, no matter


what your skill level is. I have been


using this nonstop for the past month. I


have invested literally tens of


thousands of dollars into it. I know


absolutely everything there is to know


about this tool, so feel free to skip


around, but let's start off with what is


OpenClaw. OpenClaw is a 247


AI employee that is just constantly


running on your computer finding


valuable things to do and doing them for


you. The best part is it can literally


do anything a human being can do. I'm


not joking about that. It can go on your


computer. It can control your browser.


It can vibe code apps like you see here


right now. You can see on my screen I


have seven different open claws actively


doing work for me in this office space.


And it actually vibecoded this entire


setup that you see here by itself. I


mean quite literally anything you do on


your computer, it can do itself. It can


scroll Twitter for you. It can watch


YouTube videos. Anything you can think


of. I have it generating AI images for


me for my thumbnails. It's amazing. Some


things going on behind the scenes that


are incredible are it's it's


self-improving. It remembers everything


about you. So all your conversations,


everything you say, every detail about


your life, your goals, your ambitions,


your careers, your personal


relationships, it remembers that and


then improves itself based on that


information. For instance, if I tell it


I really enjoy using codecs to vibe


code, it will just remember that


forever. And every time it vibe codes,


it will use codecs for that. If I tell


it I'm running everything on a Mac


Studio, all the apps it builds will be


specifically for Macs. If I tell it I


live in California, it'll start making


recommendations for me for events in


California. Every time you communicate


with your OpenClaw, it gets better,


smarter, and more custom, which there is


no other AI tool on planet Earth that


has ever done this before. It's


proactive. It does work while you sleep.


Let me give you an example. So, I have


my SAS creator buddy and it is actually


actively working on this software for


me. It saw on Twitter that Elon Musk is


giving away a million dollars to the top


article on X. So what it did was it saw


that on X. It was like, "Okay, we should


build some sort of article writing


functionality." And it built out a ton


of this article writing functionality.


You see here, it shipped it and I've


gained over $10,000 of recurring revenue


based on that. All of this while I


slept. I woke up in the morning, it had


the code ready, I reviewed it, then


shipped it myself once it looks good.


That is the power of having a proactive


employee. It learns about you. It


studies things on the web. It builds


things out and creates economic value


for you even when you're away from your


computer. There has never been another


technology that can do that. And lastly,


before we go into installation, I'm


going to walk through step by step how


to set this up. It is open source. What


does that mean? It's open source. That


means you can download the code and do


whatever you want with it. It is


completely free and open source, which


allows it to be completely customizable.


So if it does something you don't want


it to do, if it forgets something, if


you want to add your own functionality


to open claw and how it works, you can


do that. So for instance, I was having a


conversation with my openclaw the other


day and it forgot a detail about me that


really bothered me. So I said, "Hey, you


forgot this about me. How can we make


sure you don't forget anything about me


again?" It actually went and built out


an entirely new memory system for itself


so it remembers everything even better.


It is completely customizable and it can


even customize itself. That is


unbelievable. That is why OpenClaw in my


opinion is the most powerful technology


I've ever used in my life and I think it


is mandatory for people to learn. So the


question becomes, how do you install it?


Do you need to buy a Mac Mini like you


see everyone doing on Twitter? Can you


put it on a VPS like every other creator


is telling you to do? The answer to that


is no. There are ways to set this up


completely for free. You don't need to


buy Mac minis. You shouldn't be putting


this on a VPS. So there are two ways to


think about installation. You can have


it local on your desk on a device or on


a VPS, a virtual private server which is


in the cloud and on the web. I highly


recommend doing this locally. I think


doing this on a VPS is a massive


critical mistake. Local is easier to set


up. It is secure by default. If you do


this on a VPS, you have to do a ton of


technical work to make it secure. Also,


I'm going to go through security in a


later chapter as well, so stick around


for that. but it is not secure on a VPS


and you have to do a lot of work to make


it secure. Local has great integration


with everything else you're doing in


your life and on your devices. It's


incredibly usable. It's just awesome to


be able to go on a computer and watch it


work as it does things. It's a lot


easier than watching like a terminal on


a cloud in a web browser somewhere. That


makes it incredibly difficult to work


with. And it's just also powerful. All


these things combined make it a very


powerful tool when you're running it


locally. If you run it on a VPS, you're


getting like 20% of the power. You're


just not getting the most out of this.


And if you're going to use a


life-changing technology like OpenClaw,


you want to get the most power out of


it. You don't want some hamstrung


version of this technology. By the way,


I'm not even joking. This is happening


in real time. My OpenClaw Henry just


texted me on my device. I don't think


you'll be able to see this, but he just


I'll bring this up on my computer. Look


at this. He just texted me that he built


out a new tool for me. It's an approvals


terminal. I was literally filming this


video and he is, "Hey, by the way, I


built this out for you. An entire


approvals terminal where I'll be able to


look at any tweets it generates, any


YouTube scripts, any thumbnails, any AI


images, and give it approval to post


straight from a terminal." That's


amazing. That was just out of nowhere.


And yes, it will text you through


Telegram or iMessage or anything you're


using. But anyway, back to the video. I


just thought that was incredible. Now


that we determined VPS is not the way to


go, local is the only way to go. The


question becomes, do I need to run out


and buy a Mac Mini? Do I have to do what


you did, Alex, and buy $20,000 worth of


Mac Studios, and you're about to spend


another 20,000 on two more? No, you do


not need to do that. In fact, I highly


encourage you not to do that. You can


easily run this on any device you


already have. If you have a old dusty


laptop in your closet, you can pull that


out. If you have a $50 Raspberry Pi


you've been tinkering around with, you


can use that as well. You don't need any


sort of complex hardware for this. So


take what you already have, install


OpenClaw on it, which I'll show you how


to do in a second. And then what you can


do is as you're using it, as you come up


with more workflows for it, if you


decide, okay, to do this workflow, I


need more powerful hardware, then you


can upgrade. Then you can upgrade to a


Mac Mini. And then you're using the Mac


Mini, like, oh man, I could really use


local models for this one specific


workflow. Then you upgrade to the Mac


Studio. You don't need to rush into


$10,000 hardware. You don't even need to


rush into $600 hardware. You can start


simple and free and then work your way


up from there. That's what I did. So,


choose a local device. If you're going


to run out and buy a new device for it,


I think the Mac Mini is the best choice


by far. It is the best value in


computing for $600. For $600, you're


getting an actually incredible computing


device. I never owned a Mac Mini before.


I bought it for OpenClaw right when I


started using it. And I thought to


myself as I was using it, man, if I ever


need a new computer again, I'm just


getting the cheapest Mac Mini. It did


everything I needed it to do. It's truly


an awesome device, but that's besides


the point. You don't need it, but if you


need a new computer, Mac Mini is mwah.


So, you got your new device set up. You


got it plugged in. You got it up and


running. Here is how you install


OpenClaw. This is super simple. I don't


get the people that have been saying,


"Oh, installation's tough. Use a VPS."


No, no, no, no. This is super simple.


Watch this. You go to openclaw.ai. I'll


put a link down below for you. You


scroll down like 3 in. You see this


quick start section here that has one


single line command. You hit copy. I


hope I didn't lose you at this point. I


hope that's not too complicated for you.


If you are on Mac, you open up your


terminal. If you're on Windows, you open


up your command line. Paste in that line


from the website and you hit enter and


it's installed. All the people saying,


"Oh, you need a VPS. It's too


complicated to install it locally." Was


that too tough? Do you need to pay some


guy $5,000 to do that for you? Who are


the people paying people to set this up


for them? This is so simple. If you


don't have enough confidence in yourself


to do what I just showed you, then you


need to examine your entire life. You


put that in, you hit enter, it's


installed. Once you have it installed,


it will take you through onboarding,


which again is super simple. The people


go online saying, "Oh, onboarding's so


tough. I don't know how to do anything."


Look yourself in the mirror. Do you


think this is going to be tough? Here we


go. You hit yes on I understand this is


powerful and risky. You hit quick start.


Then you have a couple options. First,


we have our model O provider. You have


many things you can do here. We range


from expensive and powerful like


Anthropic to very cheap but still pretty


powerful like Miniax. Then you have


things in between like OpenAI. If you


already have an existing subscription


like an Anthropic subscription, like an


OpenAI subscription, you can just go in


and plug it in and use it. If you don't


have any existing subscriptions, you can


sign up for a brand new one like Miniax.


Miniax is dirt cheap. You can pay like


$10 a month and be able to use OpenClaw


with it, and it's still a pretty good


model to use with it. So, you can do


that as well. Now, again, the most


powerful option here is going to be Opus


4.6. Opus 4.6 is just built for these


types of activities. It is the smartest


model and it is also the most personable


model. It has the most riz. It's the


warmest. It's the most fun to talk to.


it has the most motion. The issue is is


you're going to be paying like $200 a


month for that subscription. Now, the


first question I get whenever I talk


about Anthropic is, "Oh, am I going to


get banned for this?" Does Anthropic


want you using their subscription with


OpenClaw? No, they do not. Out of all


the AI companies in the world, Anthropic


is the one that is most against using


OpenClaw with their subscription. I will


just say this, I've heard of people


getting banned from their Anthropic


subscription for doing that. I'll also


say this. I've never met any of them.


Everyone's like, "Oh, yeah. I've heard


of someone who got banned, but I've


never talked to someone who's actually


got banned." So, I don't know if this is


just a rumor going around or what it is.


I'd say this. I'm not going to tell you


to break terms of service with


Anthropic. Wink wink. But you're free to


do what you want. So, if you want to use


your Anthropic subscription, wink wink,


you would choose Anthropic here and hit


enter. Then, it gives you the


instructions to getting your Anthropic


authorization token. You literally copy


this, open up a new terminal, paste it


in. That will ask you to log into


Anthropic. You do that. That's going to


give you a token, which is a really long


string of letters and numbers. Here's


where most people mess up with this.


Copy that. Don't just paste it into


OpenClaw. Paste it into a notepad. So,


Apple Notes or Notepad. Then, make sure


the formatting is correct. And what I


mean by that, make sure there's no line


breaks or anything that's splitting up


the token. Make sure it's all just one


line. Then you can copy it from there


once it's on one line and paste it back


here into OpenClaw and then you'll be


good to go and it'll work. Open AAI has


actually been the opposite of anthropic.


They've been like, "Yeah, go ahead. We


don't care. Use it with OpenClaw." So,


you can do that as well. Downside being


is their model just doesn't feel quite


as warm as Anthropic. It's not quite as


fun to talk to, but it's still a very


powerful model. And if you already have


a Chad GBT subscription, you're good to


go. And then, as I mentioned, if you


want to go cheap, Miniax is a great


model to save tons of money. Will it be


as warm? Will it have quite as much RZ?


No. But for the money and value you're


getting, it might be the best bang for


the buck. Right after this menu, when


you select your AI model, it's going to


ask you to set up your messaging


service. The coolest part about OpenClaw


is you don't interface with it through a


website. You don't interface with it


through a app that you barely ever use.


You interface through it with apps you


already use today. iMessage, Telegram,


Discord. This is the most fun part about


Open Clause. You can just text it


anywhere you are. So, you're going to be


able to choose which app you want to


use. I highly recommend Telegram. I


think Telegram is the best way to do it.


Telegram has a bunch of really cool


options like threading and chunking. So,


it actually comes in the text like


you're talking to an AI, which is


awesome. Telegram, I think, is the best


way to do this. So, download Telegram.


It's free. It's easy to use. It's easy


to set up. And it will walk you through


step by step, really, really simple, how


to set it up from there. Then you'll be


good to go, and you got OpenC Claw set


up, and you didn't need a tech genius to


do it for you. You didn't need to spend


$5,000 on setup. You're good to go. You


did it yourself for free. So, now that


you're all set up, you've hatched your


Open Claw, you your assistant is born.


First of all, congratulations. Pat


yourself on the back. You did something


that only the top 1% of humanity is


doing right now, which is hatching an


open claw and using the most powerful


technology of all time. You did it. You


are most of the way there to escaping


the permanent underclass. Now you just


need to use it. Once you use it, you've


escaped the permanent underclass. What


I'm going to do is show you the first


two basic things you need to do with


OpenClaw. Then I'm going to right after


that go over some advanced concepts and


the mindset you need to get the most out


of OpenClaw. That will be after these


first two use cases I'll give to you and


then we'll go into some more advanced


things after that. Again, feel free to


work with me. Pause down below. Do


things side by side with the video. Skip


around to different chapters, whatever


you want. This is free form. And if


you're feeling extra spicy, you can even


hand this video over in your OpenClaw


and I'll watch it for you. So, let's


talk about the two first things you need


to do now that you're in OpenClaw. So,


after setup, it'll give you a link to


this gateway dashboard. This is the


website you can use to communicate with


your open claw. This is complimentary to


your Telegram or Discord setup. You can


use either or. They're both exactly the


same thing. The first thing you need to


do though is introduce yourself to your


open claw. Let's play pretend for a


second. You have your own business. You


hired a new employee. What's the first


thing you would do? You would tell them


about yourself, the company, what your


the goals and missions are of the


company, everything like that. You want


to do the exact same thing with your


open claw. So, open up your gateway


dashboard. Go to the chat down here. And


you want to braindump everything about


you. You want to brain dump who you are


in your background. So, for instance,


I'd say I'm Alex Finn. I'm a software


engineer. I studied computer science. I


was a developer for years and then I


managed a team of tech consultants at a


big tech company. And now I create


content about AI, build out software,


and do a whole bunch of other things.


I'd brain dump that all in. Then I'd go


through my personal preferences. I'd


say, I want you to be proactive. I want


you to be autonomous. You don't need


permission for everything. Just get


things done. Advance our goals and


missions as much as you can. You're


giving your personal preferences for how


you want to work with your employee. And


then lastly, you want to brain dump your


goals and ambitions. This is probably


the most important part of all this.


What are you trying to achieve in your


life? For me, my goals and ambitions


were I want to create a 247 autonomous


company that creates value. And then I


want to be able to create content around


every single cool thing I do with it.


That's my goal and ambition because if I


can do those two things, one, I can make


money without putting as much work in.


And two, I can keep advancing my YouTube


and my Twitter feeds and all that


because I'll be creating content around


everything I do. So, I'm putting in all


my goals and ambitions. I also said I


want to make a million dollars in a year


through my SAS and through my different


products. And I put that all in. And now


me and my open claw are on the same


exact page. And everything we do


together will be in an effort to get


closer to those goals and ambitions. So


you want to do the exact same thing. If


you don't know what your goals and


ambitions are, you can just put in, I


want to start my own online business and


make my first dollar. Something like


that. Just put that in so your open claw


is aware of your goals and ambitions.


And the best part is it's going to


remember all of this. It will be saved


to memory and every conversation you


have moving forward that will be


included in context. So you brain dump


those in. Your open claw knows


absolutely everything about you. Now


you're ready to cook. You've been


introduced to your open claw. You're


best friends now. Your best pals. You


have a digital BFF. That's amazing. Now


we can start getting to work and get


productive. The first thing I have


everyone set up when they're in OpenClaw


is a morning brief, a custom


personalized morning brief. This is a


report your OpenClaw will send you


autonomously every single morning that


gives you all the information you need


to know about that day. My openclaw


Henry sent me this this morning. It is


Valentine's Day today and it actually


started with good morning and happy


Valentine's Day. Very nice touch by


Henry. But it gave me an entire morning


brief. Gave me the weather. It gave me


all the news about my interest. So knows


I'm super into vibe coding. I love


Claude Code. I love Codeex. It gave me


all the new trends in vibe coding. It


spent all night researching the news,


reading the news for me, figuring out


what was relevant. It gave me a bunch of


ideas for videos I can film today. So, I


wake up, maybe I don't have any ideas


for videos. I can go, oh, Henry gave me


a few right here, and I can choose one


of them and film much easier. And the


best part is actually writing me the


scripts and sending it to my Discord.


But that's an advanced workflow we'll go


through a little bit later. It's also


going through my tasks and to-do list.


So, it's connected to my Things three,


which is the to-do list app I use, and


it's able to tell me what tasks I have


on there and even what tasks I assign to


Henry on there. So, I wake up, I know


exactly what I need to start tackling


that day. And then it gave me


recommendations for tasks I need to do


right away. So, choosing a video angle,


going through our approval queue, which


is a bunch of tweets and content that


came up for me, and I just need to


approve it. And then that's a nice


little touch there, telling me to enjoy


it cuz it's Valentine's Day. you need to


have your own custom morning brief like


this. And this is super easy to set up.


So here's a little bit about how this


works. Your open claw at any time can


just schedule things to do in the


future. So it uses what's called cron


jobs, which is basically just scheduled


tasks to do things in the future. So if


I say, "Hey, bills me a morning brief


every morning at 6:00 a.m." It will


schedule in perpetuity forever 6:00 a.m.


every day for it to do something. So


this is how we do it. We'd say, I put


this down in the description below.


Please schedule a brief for me every day


at 8 a.m. Send it to my telegram in the


morning brief. I want number one, the


weather wherever you are. Number two,


the top news stories in AI. This could


be any interest you have that you want


news on. Number three, any task I have


in my to-do list on things. Three, this


can be whatever to-do list app you're


currently using. And number four, task


you can complete for me today that


brings me closer to my goals. This is


probably the most important one because


what this allows your open claw to do is


think for itself. What can I do to


complete tasks for my boss? And this


will open up doors you've never thought


of before. You're going to be doing this


as much as possible. And I'm going to


talk about this a little bit later in


the video. It's called reverse


prompting. It's instead of us telling


what OpenC claw to do, we're letting


open claw think for itself to figure out


what to do. Much more on that coming up.


You're going to hit enter on this and


you're going to be good to go. By the


way, if you've learned anything so far,


we've covered a ton. Make sure to leave


a like down below. Make sure to


subscribe and turn on notifications cuz


all I do is create incredible videos


about OpenClaw. And also, if you want


live boot camps, every Friday I do a


live boot camp on OpenClaw where you can


hang out with me, ask me questions, see


live demos. I do it all in the vibe


coding academy. Link for that is down


below. We have, at the time of filming,


600 people in the Vibe Coding Academy


joining these live boot camps every


Friday. So, I hope to see you there. So,


feel free to customize this prompt any


way you want with anything you want in


your morning brief. Make this custom to


you and you're not locked into this. You


can at a later point go back and say,


"Hey, tweak my morning brief with this,


tweak it with that." Again, this is


constantly self-improving this open


claw. Next, I want to talk about mission


control. Now that we have our morning


brief set up, the next big thing you're


going to want to do as one of your first


use cases is build a mission control.


What's a mission control? It is a custom


dashboard for you and your open claw to


build the tools you need to be


productive and get closer to your goals.


This is what my mission control looks


like here. I've been building this out


for weeks now. As you can see in the


lefth hand side, there are tons of


different custom tools me and my


openclaw built out together. This was


all vibecoded by my openclaw Henry. I


didn't write any of this code myself. I


didn't even vibe code this myself. I


said, "Henry, go and build a mission


control for me." And it vibe coded it


for itself. That's not vibe coding. I


call this vibe orchestration. We're vibe


orchestrating our open claw. So, you


want to build this out, too. You want to


have your OpenClaw build you out a


mission control where it can build any


of the custom tools it needs. things


like to-do lists, things like places to


track all your sub aents like I have


here. Things like an approvals queue


where it can write you content and you


can just approve it and it sends it out.


All these are custom tools you can build


out. The number one request I get is,


"Hey, can you open source your mission


control?" Yes, I will do that


eventually, but I do not recommend that


as the way to setting up your mission


control. Your mission control should be


completely custom to you, your goals,


your ambitions, and your open claw. So


what you want to do is now that we have


our morning brief set up. Go to your


open claw and say this. I put this


prompt down below. Feel free to copy and


paste it. I want you to set up a mission


control. This is a custom place for us


to build out any tools we need to be


more productive. Please build this using


Nex.js and host it locally. That will


cause your open claw to go vibe code


mission control for you which will just


be a custom dashboard. And then from


there you'll be able to go and say hey


let's build a to-do list together,


right? Let's build a visualization of


you working. Anything you need, it can


then go and vibe code it inside your


mission control. You don't need coding


experience for this. It can just do it


for you. And now as you're working, the


mindset becomes, okay, what can we build


out to make this workflow simpler? What


can we build out to make this easier for


us? Anytime you have your open claw do


something, you can say, hey, how would


we do this with a custom tool in our


mission control? Again, that's reverse


prompting, which is probably the most


important concept in AI. Instead of


telling your bot what you want it to


build, you're saying based on what you


know about us and what we do, what


should we build? You're asking your bot


questions. Just reverse prompt as much


as you can, and it will start building


out these custom tools for you in your


mission control. The next advanced


concept I want to talk about will save


you money and improve your workflows,


and that's the concept of brains and


muscles with your open claw. The way I


like to think about it is whatever model


you chose during setup is your brain.


It's the one that orchestrates and


decides what to do. And then you can use


other models as muscles. These are going


to be the models that actually do work


and create things. So Opus 46 currently


is the best brain in the world. It is


the best to talk to. It is the best


decision maker. I like using Opus as the


brain. Again, it's very expensive. So I


like to use other models as muscles. So


for instance, for coding, I like to use


codeex for the muscle because that's


very cheap but still very powerful. For


finding the latest news, I like to use


XAI. So whether that's the X API or the


Gro API because XAI is very good at


figuring out what's trending at the


moment because it's hooked into social


media. For searching the web, I like to


use the Brave API. The Brave API is a


very good and cheap API for searching


the web and finding current information.


And so that's the muscle I use for


searching the web. You want to set up


these brains and muscles. You already


have the brain set up. So all you need


to do now is go to your open claw and


say, "Hey, for coding moving forward,


please use the codec cli." Then it will


ask you for your open AAI API key. You


give it to it. You got that muscle set


up. Then you say, "Hey, for finding


tweets, I want you to use the X API."


It'll ask you for your API key. Boom,


you're set up. You have that muscle set


up. Now, moving forward, your brain,


which is opus, can save tokens because


it's not doing everything itself. It's


instead spinning up other muscles and


other models to do that work for it. So,


you're not only saving money on tokens,


but you are also using the best models


for the best jobs out there, which is


huge. It makes your workflow more


efficient. Now, where we start getting a


little bit more advanced is when it


comes to local models. The endgame in my


mind is when we start using local models


for each one of these muscles. I spent


over the last few weeks $20,000 on Mac


Studios. Why did I do that? I wanted the


most powerful computers humanly possible


that will allow me to run local models.


What are local models? Those are AI


models that are not run on the internet,


in the cloud, in servers. They are


instead run on your computer. And that


has many benefits. that allows you to


have a unlimited token so you can just


do whatever you want locally and b gives


you your own personalized local


intelligence. I believe this is the


future. So what I started doing is I


started using local models for some of


these muscles. So for instance coding I


now use MiniAX 2.5 completely locally.


Now all coding is done completely free


for me locally on my computer. Now does


this mean you need to go out and spend


$10,000 on a Mac Studio? No. But as you


get more advanced and as you set up more


of these workflows, you can start to


think about as you go along. Okay, maybe


I can replace this workflow with a local


model or this one and then you can


slowly upgrade your hardware from there.


So local models is definitely a concept


you want to consider. I strongly believe


in the near future we will have super


intelligent local models that we can run


on our computers where we don't have to


spend a penny on tokens anymore. It all


happens locally. I started preparing for


that future by buying a Mac Studio. You


can run local models on Mac minis. They


won't be as powerful, but at least you


can get them running and you can get


used to a future where you have local


intelligence running on your computers.


On top of that, they're just super fun


to play with, super interesting to use.


You learn a lot more about the


technology. You get a lot more familiar


with AI. So, I can't recommend it


enough. Start doing research into local


models. Start spitting them up. you'll


have a lot of fun and you'll get a more


advanced workflow out of it. I also want


to get into some more advanced concepts


here, which is the open claw mindset.


How you want to think about open claw


overall. Number one is I see a lot of


people making mistakes when it comes to


using their open claw. I see them doing


things that break their open claw and it


never works again. I see them


communicating with it in a way that's


just inefficient. Here's the mindset you


need to have with openclaw. One is it is


a super intelligent human being


employee. you are the manager of this


human being employee. I see a lot of


people going in and they're like, "Oh, I


want to change the way OpenClaw works


here. I wanted to do this instead." And


they go in and they mess with the config


files and they change things around.


That's the stupidest thing you can do.


That's how you break your open claw. If


you want your open claw to behave


differently, you don't go in and change


config files. You say, "Hey, open claw,


I want you to do this differently, or


I'd like you to do this." You give it


goals and objectives. You don't tell it


how to do things. You tell it what the


end state you want is and it goes and


figures out how to get to that end


state. So if for instance it has the


concept of heartbeats, what are


heartbeats? Heartbeats are every half


hour it goes and it checks to see if it


has any tasks it needs to do


automatically. Say you want to speed up


heartbeats. You want it to be every 5


minutes instead because you have a


really advanced workflow you're doing.


What I'm seeing a lot of people doing is


they're going in the config file and


they're manually changing the heartbeat.


No, you want to give it a goal and it


will figure out the best way to do that.


So you say, "Hey, Open Claw, I want you


to change your heartbeat to every 5


minutes." It will go and figure out the


right way to edit its own stuff. You


give the endstate goal, it figures out


the way. Stop thinking about how it


should do things. It's a super


intelligent employee. It will figure out


the best way to do things. Next, reverse


prompting is your friend. This is the


most important recommendation I can


give. Reverse prompting because this is


a super intelligent human employee. You


want to lean on it as much as possible


for decision-making. You don't want to


make all the decisions yourself. You


want to say, "Hey, what's the best way


to do this?" Or, "Based on what you know


about me, what would you do here?" Or,


"Based on our goals and ambitions, what


would you build out in our mission


control?" You're constantly asking


questions rather than telling it what to


do. The more questions you ask your open


claw, the better the results will be.


I'll tell you this, the more reverse


prompts you can do on a daily basis, the


more powerful your open claw will be.


So, reverse prompt, reverse prompt,


reverse prompt. Write that down on a


post-it note. Put it on your monitor.


Reverse prompt as much as humanly


possible and you'll get way more power


out of open cloth. And here's an


important one as well. Anytime it messes


up, anytime it has a task it can't do,


ask it to figure it out and build a


solution. So, for instance, I said, I


want you to be able to send me tweets


and then wait for my approval to send


the tweets out. When I asked to do that,


it didn't have an approvals queue. So,


it went out and built its own approvals


queue for me inside my mission control.


anything it can't do, just have it build


it out. It is a self-improving bot.


Anytime it messes up, so maybe it


forgets something or it does something


the wrong way, say, "Hey, pause right


there, Open Claw. Build a new skill that


solves this problem." So, for instance,


I wanted to write my newsletters. Link


to my newsletters down below. I wanted


to send me drafts every single Wednesday


night, and it wrote me a couple


newsletters, and they both stunk. So, I


said, "Hey, let's pause here. Read


through all my past newsletters, then


build a newsletter skill that helps you


write better newsletters." It went, it


built this new skill, and now it's


self-improved. Anytime it can't do


something, or anytime it does something


poorly, say, "Hey, pause. Figure it out.


Build a skill to do this better, build a


tool in our mission control to do this


better." And moving forward, it will be


better and give you way better results.


Remember, it is self-improving. And keep


that in mind anytime you do something.


So, I went through the basics. I went


through some more advanced things. I


went through a couple use cases for you


here. Let's go through another advanced


workflow for you here. I think Discord


is incredible for advanced workflows.


You can set up multiple channels inside


Discord to have bots in and do different


things with them. So, for instance, I


have an alerts channel where every two


hours Henry goes and finds me trending


tweets on X about my favorite subjects.


I then have a research channel where


Henry will go take the trending tweets


and then do more investigative work on


those stories. Then I have a scripts


channel where then it then takes those


stories and writes me YouTube scripts


based on those stories. As you can see,


I have this huge workflow where every


channel Henry's doing something


different in and I can just go in and


have a record of all the work he did.


Highly recommend taking advantage of


Discord. I don't see Discord as a


replacement for Telegram. I see Discord


as a supplement for Telegram. So go in,


say, "Hey, say OpenClaw, I want you to


build me out an advanced Discord


workflow. What do you think would be


channels we could have in there that


would make our workflow even better?"


Boom. A little reverse prompt for you


right there. And then you go in and it


will build out the Discord setup for


you. Easy peasy. And now you have this


advanced workflow going. Lastly, I want


to talk about security. This is one of


the biggest questions I get. Is Open


Claw secure? Is it dangerous? Well, let


me be blunt with you right here. Is it


secure? If you use it the right way,


yes. If you don't use it the right way,


no. It's not secure. and it can do


damage, but the fact that it's so


powerful makes it insecure. Just is what


it is. If it wasn't so dangerous, it


wouldn't be nearly as powerful. So, here


are a few rules you need to keep in


mind. There are no final list of every


single tiny security thing you can do


because everyone uses their bot


differently. So, here are the three


highle things you need to keep in mind.


One is your open claw has control over


everything on your computer. Anything on


your computer, your open claw is exposed


to. That means if you have passwords on


your computer, if you have API keys on


your computer, that means your open claw


has access to it. So your open claw has


basically admin access to your entire


digital life. If you're logged in to X


on your computer, it has access to your


entire Twitter account. If you're logged


into your Gmail on your computer, it has


access to all your emails and can email


anyone out. It is admin on everything on


your computer. So that means if you


don't want your open claw to have access


to something, don't be logged into it on


your computer. That also means you don't


want to expose your open claw to the


world. What does that mean? If you


expose your open claw to the world, so


say put it in a group chat with your


friends or allow it to reply to tweets


on X, that means it can get prompt


injected. And if it gets prompt


injected, that means it can expose


anything it has access to like your


passwords and API keys. So, I highly


recommend against putting your open claw


on group chats. I highly recommend


against allowing anyone to have access


to your open claw because if they have


access to your open claw, they have


access to all your passwords and API


keys and email accounts and Twitter


accounts and all that. So, keep it


personal, keep it private. Do not allow


anyone to talk to it, expose itself to


it, anything like that. I don't have it


reading my tweet replies. I don't have


it reading my emails. I will eventually


get to the point where I put up the


guard rails around it to make it safe,


but right now I just have it doing


personal work on my computer. And the


last security tip I will give is think


deeply about what your claw will do with


every prompt you give it. Before you


give it a prompt, think will this expose


it to the world? Will this make it do


something risky? Will it allow it to get


prompt injected in some sort of way? If


you think deeply about every prompt you


give it, you will be able to stop it


from doing stupid and bad things. Right?


So three is think deeply with every


command you give what your claw is going


to do. And you can even take it a step


further and say, "Hey, before you do


anything, open claw, give me a


step-by-step plan on what you plan on


doing here." If you keep these three


things in mind, there's basically


nothing you'll be able to do where bad


things will happen. It's all about


personal responsibility. As they said in


Spider-Man, with great power comes great


responsibility. If you're using Open


Claw, you have great great power. So,


make sure you have great great


responsibility with it. There are


hundreds of more advanced use cases. If


you want more looks into those, check


out my channel. I have so many videos


about OpenClaw. Let me know down in the


replies below. What do you want to see


more of on the channel about OpenClaw?


Do you want more videos on mission


control? Do you want more videos on


local models? Do you want more videos on


more advanced use cases, security? Let


me know. All my videos are based on


feedback and requests. So, I listen


closely to every single comment. Again,


if you want to ask me questions


directly, feel free to join the live


Open Claw boot camps, which are every


single Friday. If you join Vibe Coding


Academy now, you get all the past


recordings to the boot camps. That


link's down below. Super critical you


turn on notifications, too, so you learn


about these advanced workflows the


moment I come up with them. I hope this


was helpful. So much more coming out on


Open Claw soon. Enjoy the power, enjoy


the technology. This is the most amazing


time to be alive ever.
