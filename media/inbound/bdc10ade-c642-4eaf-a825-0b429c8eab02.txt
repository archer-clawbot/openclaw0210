Today I'm going to show you how to use


Notebook LM to rank number one on


Google. This thing just got a massive


upgrade. It's now 10 times smarter. It


can do your research in seconds and it


can write content that actually ranks.


And I'm going to walk you through the


exact workflow I use step by step. No


fluff. Let's go. Hey, if we haven't met


already, I'm the digital avatar of


Julian Goldie, CEO of SEO agency Goldie


Agency. Whilst he's helping clients get


more leads and customers, I'm here to


help you get the latest AI updates.


Julian Goldie reads every comment, so


make sure you comment below. Right, let


me tell you what just happened. Google


dropped Gemini 3 into Notebook LM, and


this changes everything for SEO. Before


this update, Notebook LM was good for


taking notes. Now, it thinks, it


reasons, it analyzes, it builds full


research reports, it creates content


ready to publish. This is not just a


note-taking app anymore. This is an SEO


machine. Here's what's new. First,


Gemini 3 integration. This means


Notebook LM now has better reasoning. It


understands context. It generates


smarter outputs for a co. This means you


can create content that actually matches


what people are searching for. No more


guessing. No more copying and pasting


between 10 different tools. You upload


your sources and Notebook LM does the


thinking for you. Second, deep research


mode. This is crazy. You can upload


hundreds of documents or URLs. Notebook


LM reads all of them. Then it extracts


the main ideas. It builds tables. It


creates comparisons. It gives you SEO


ready briefs all automatically. Think


about this for a second. You want to


rank for a keyword in the AI automation


space. You grab the top 20 pages that


already rank. You upload them to


Notebook LM and it tells you exactly


what topics they cover, what keywords


they use, and what gaps you can fill.


That's the power here. Third, better


custom chats and goals. The chat window


is bigger now. You can set specific


goals. You can tell it to act like an


SEO strategist. You can say create a


content plan for the AI profit boardroom


and it does it. The prompts work better.


You don't need to keep tweaking them.


You tell it what you want once and it


delivers. Fourth, export and workflow


features. This is where it gets


practical. Notebook LM can now export


directly to Google Sheets and Docs. It


can build data tables from your


research. It can create slide decks. It


can make infographics. This means you go


from research to final deliverable


without switching tools. You save hours.


And by the way, I'll show you exactly


how to do this in a minute. And one more


thing, if you're creating all this


content with Notebook LM, but nobody is


finding it online, you've got a traffic


problem. That's where SEO comes in. If


you want more leads, more traffic, and


more sales, my team can help you rank


higher on Google. Check the link in the


comments and description to order AI SEO


online and let us handle your back links


while you focus on growing your


business. All right, now let me show you


the workflow. This is what I use. This


is what works. There are four prompts.


Each one builds on the last one. By the


end, you have content ready to publish.


I'm going to use the AI profit boardroom


as the example here, but you can swap in


your own business and your own keywords.


The workflow stays the same. Let me walk


you through each prompt. Pay attention


because these are the exact prompts


you'll use. Prompt one, research the


keyword how to use AI automation to grow


online communities. Gather top 20


ranking pages and build a ranked table


of common topics, primary and secondary


keywords, search intent classification,


and gaps we can exploit. Provide a


source link summary. You use this first.


This builds your foundation. You need to


know what's already ranking before you


create anything. Notebook LM reads all


those pages. It pulls out the patterns.


It shows you what works. It shows you


what's missing. This is your road map.


The key here is you're not just getting


a list of keywords. You're getting an


analysis of what's working in your


space. For the AI profit boardroom, this


keyword targets people who want to grow


communities using AI. That's exactly who


we want to reach. This prompt helps you


understand the landscape. It helps you


see where the opportunities are, and it


does it faster than any manual research


process. You're gathering intelligence


before you create anything. You're


seeing what your competitors are doing


and you're finding the gaps they're not


filling. Prompt two, create an SEO


optimized content outline for a blog


post about using AI automation to grow


online communities specifically for the


AI profit boardroom audience. Include


target keywords, headings, suggested


word count, metatitle and description,


FAQ ideas, and internal link targets.


This turns your research into a


blueprint. You now have your structure.


You have your headings. You have your


keywords. You have your FAQ section.


Everything's mapped out. You're not


staring at a blank page anymore. You


have a plan. This is where you go from


data to strategy. The outline gives you


direction. It tells you what sections to


write. It tells you how long each


section should be. It gives you the meta


tags you need for Google. For the AI


profit boardroom, this means structuring


content that speaks directly to business


owners who want to use AI to automate


and grow their communities. You're


building with purpose. Every piece has a


reason to exist, and you're doing it


based on what already ranks, not what


you think might work. The outline


becomes your guide for everything that


comes next. Prompt three, write the


first, 1200 words of a blog post based


on the outline. Focus on how AI


automation helps grow online communities


like the AI profit boardroom. Keep SEO


best practices in mind. Add natural


keyword placement and include internal


and external links. Use a friendly and


practical tone for entrepreneurs who


want to scale their communities with AI.


This generates your main content draft.


It writes in the tone you want. It


includes keywords naturally. It adds


links where they make sense. You're not


starting from scratch. You're editing


something that's already mostly done.


The beauty of this prompt is


specificity. You're telling it exactly


who you're writing for. You're telling


it what tone to use. You're telling it


to follow SEO best practices. For the AI


profit boardroom, we want a tone that's


friendly but practical. We're talking to


entrepreneurs. We're talking to people


who want real solutions. The more


specific you are, the better the output.


And because you already fed it the


research and the outline, the content


stays on track. Prompt four, review the


draft blog post about AI automation for


growing online communities. Improve SEO


quality, including readability, keyword


density, and topic coverage. Produce and


SEO checklist, meta tags and structured


data suggestions. Also, generate a brief


analytics plan to track performance


after publishing. This is your final


step. This takes your draft and makes it


publish ready. It checks your keyword


usage. It improves how easy it is to


read. It gives you the technical SEO


elements you need. It even helps you


plan how to measure success after you


publish. This prompt is about


refinement. You're taking something good


and making it great. You're catching


things you might have missed. You're


making sure your content meets all the


requirements Google looks for and you're


setting yourself up to track what


happens next for content about the AI


profit boardroom. This means making sure


you're not overusing keywords, making


sure your paragraphs are easy to read,


making sure you have all your meta


descriptions and title tags ready. It's


the final quality check before anything


goes live. This is where you turn a


draft into a finished piece that's ready


to perform. So now you have a complete


workflow. You have the research phase


with prompt one. You have the planning


phase with prompt two. You have the


creation phase with prompt three. And


you have the polish phase with prompt


four. Each prompt builds on the one


before it. Each prompt moves you closer


to publish ready content. And you're


doing all of this in one tool. No


jumping around, no switching context,


just a straight line from idea to


finished piece. Try this workflow. Use


these prompts and let me know how it


goes. Drop a comment below with your


experience. And one more thing, if


you're creating all this content with


Notebook LM, but nobody is finding it


online, you've got a traffic problem.
