7. Review count unknown but likely very low vs competitors (Hebe: 613, Rejuva: 297)
8. Zero city silo pages (no Glenville hub, no spoke pages)
9. robots.txt incomplete — no Sitemap declaration, no disallow for member pages
10. Encoded chars in URL slugs (%C2%AE, %2C, %40) causing crawl issues

### sandbags.info
**Onboarded:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** Pre-Launch — Technical Sprint + Publishing Pending

**Business Details:**
- **Domain:** sandbags.info
- **Current Live Site:** ESR (Emergency Sandbag Response) — B2B municipal flood mitigation service on Squarespace (NOT the content site being audited)
- **Planned Site Type:** National content/authority site (non-local, non-e-commerce)
- **Methodology:** CATALYST-N (National SEO)
- **Website Platform:** Squarespace (platform migration to WordPress STRONGLY recommended)
- **Monetization:** Lead generation (sandbag delivery + filling service partners) + display advertising
- **Target Audience:** Homeowners, contractors, emergency responders, military

**Content Architecture (Planned — 63 pages):**
- Pillar 1: Fundamentals (~10 supporting pages)
- Pillar 2: Flood Protection (~15 supporting pages)
- Pillar 3: Types & Materials (~12 supporting pages)
- Pillar 4: Commercial Uses (~10 supporting pages)
- Pillar 5: Buying Guides (~16 supporting pages)

**CATALYST-N Audit:**
- **Audit Date:** 2026-02-17
- **Overall Score:** 1.4/10 (Pre-Launch Baseline — Expected)
- **Audit File:** `deliverables/sandbags-info/silas/2026-02-17-national-seo-audit.md`

**Critical Findings (Priority Order):**
1. CRITICAL: robots.txt blocks ALL AI crawlers (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, anthropic-ai, Google-Extended) — must fix before launch
2. Platform limitation: Squarespace severely caps CWV performance (mobile scores typically 40-65) and schema flexibility
3. Zero indexed content for target keywords — 63 pages not live yet
4. Zero backlink authority — starting from scratch
5. No schema (no Article, FAQ, HowTo, Organization, BreadcrumbList)
6. No E-E-A-T signals — YMYL-adjacent content with zero credentials established
7. Sitemap incomplete — only shows blog posts, not main pages
8. Sandbag Calculator missing from content plan — high-value linkable asset
9. No GA4 or GSC set up
10. No internal link architecture planned for 63-page cluster

**Top Keyword Opportunities:**
- how to fill sandbags (18K–22K/mo) — Fundamentals pillar

- types of sandbags (3.5K–5K/mo) — Types & Materials pillar
- best sandbags for flooding (5K–8K/mo) — Buying Guides pillar
- sandbag calculator (6K–9K/mo) — MISSING from plan; must add

**Top Competitors:**
1. palmetto-industries.com — Est. DR 35-45, best informational content + calculator, tops Featured Snippets
2. esandbags.com — Est. DR 30-40, original online sandbag store, e-commerce + content
3. sandbagstore.com — Est. DR 25-35, strong selection guides
4. sandbagstogo.com — Est. DR 20-30, strong FAQ content
5. sandbaggy.com — Est. DR 25-35, commercial + informational blend

**Access Needed from Operator:**
- Platform decision (Squarespace keep vs. WordPress migration)
- CMS access to publish 63 content pages
- GSC and GA4 account setup

**Updated Topical Map Decisions (2026-02-17):**
- Updated map file: `deliverables/sandbags-info/silas/2026-02-17-updated-topical-map.md`
- Net page count: 83 content + 4 utility/E-E-A-T = **87 pages total** (up from 80+ in original); full architecture including Phase 3 = ~108 unique pages
- Pages removed: 6 (tree staking, dust control, leveling, fitness FAQ, filling stations [merged], sandbag-materials [merged])
- Pages merged: 3 (shelf-life + lifespan-outdoor → `/how-long-do-sandbags-last/`; filling-stations → how-to-fill)
- Pages added: 16 (calculator pillar, DIY wall, emergency cluster, state guides ×8, E-E-A-T pages, pipeline protection, UV-resistant, military-spec)
- **NEW Pillar 6:** Tools & Calculators — `/sandbag-calculator/` is P1 Phase 1; beats palmetto-industries.com calculator
- **Phase 1 expanded** from 13 → 21 pages; added: calculator, DIY wall, alternatives, garage door, disposal (all elevated from Phase 2)
- **Military sandbags** moved from Pillar 4 → Pillar 3 (product type, not commercial application)
- **Fitness FAQ removed** (no fitness cluster = topical orphan; do not add Fitness pillar)
- **E-E-A-T pages required pre-launch:** `/about/`, `/editorial-policy/`, `/contact/` before any content publishes
- **State guides expanded:** 4 → 12 states; Phase 1: FL, TX, CA, LA; Phase 2: NC, GA, SC, MS, AL; Phase 3: IA, MO, KY
- **Service pages integrated into Pillar 5 + Phase 1** (not orphaned at bottom of site)
- **Traffic targets revised downward** to realistic range for new domain (Month 3: 200-600 vs. original 1,000)

- Scribe written: **63 pages** in `deliverables/sandbags-info/scribe/`
- Still valid in updated map: **57 pages** ✅
- Needs restructuring (new URL): **1 page** — `/military-sandbags/` → `/military-spec-sandbags/`
- Content merged (fold into target): **3 pages** — filling-stations → how-to-fill; materials → types-of-sandbags; shelf-life → how-long-do-sandbags-last
- Cut entirely: **2 pages** — dust-control, tree-staking (archive)
- Total still to write: **51 pages** (11 Phase 1, 29 Phase 2, 11 Phase 3)
- **Top Phase 1 gaps (by volume):** `/bulk-sandbags/` (10K–18K/mo), `/sandbag-delivery-services/` (5K–9K/mo), `/best-sandbags-for-flooding/` (5K–8K/mo), `/diy-sandbag-wall/` (2K–3.5K/mo)
- **Pre-launch blockers:** `/about/`, `/editorial-policy/`, `/contact/` — must publish BEFORE any content page goes live
- **Tools gap:** `/tools/` hub, `/sandbag-weight-calculator/`, `/sandbag-wall-calculator/` — all Phase 1, none written
- **Biggest structural gap:** Pillar 4 has NO hub page — `/commercial-sandbag-uses/` not yet written (Phase 2 priority)
- **Content updates needed on existing pages:** Add filling-station section to how-to-fill; add materials subsection to types-of-sandbags
- Phase 1 regional guides 100% complete (FL, TX, CA, LA all written)
- Phase 1 content pages: 17 of 21 written (81%); 4 missing: bulk-sandbags, best-sandbags-for-flooding, diy-sandbag-wall, sandbag-delivery-services
