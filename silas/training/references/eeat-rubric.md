## Component Weights

| Component | Weight | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| Experience (E1) | 20% | First-hand experience signals; newer addition, growing importance |
| Expertise (E2) | 25% | Demonstrated knowledge depth in the subject matter |
| Authoritativeness (A) | 25% | Recognition by others in the field; external validation |
| Trustworthiness (T) | 30% | Foundation of all other signals; Google's stated most important factor |

**Composite E-E-A-T Score = (E1 * 0.20) + (E2 * 0.25) + (A * 0.25) + (T * 0.30)**

Score each component 0-10, then compute weighted composite.

## Experience (E1) — Weight: 20%

Measures whether content demonstrates first-hand, real-world experience with the topic.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | No evidence of real experience. Generic content that could be written by anyone. No case studies, photos, or specific examples. |
| 3-4 | Minimal experience signals. May mention "years in business" but no specific evidence. Stock photos only. |
| 5-6 | Some experience demonstrated. Real project photos, a few case studies or testimonials, but not consistently across the site. |
| 7-8 | Strong experience signals. Multiple case studies with specifics (before/after, timelines, costs). Real photos of work. Customer stories with verifiable details. |
| 9-10 | Exceptional experience proof. Extensive portfolio, detailed case studies with measurable outcomes, video walkthroughs of work, customer video testimonials, process documentation. |

**Signals to evaluate:**
- Real photos of completed work (not stock)
- Case studies with specific details (project scope, timeline, cost, outcome)
- Process documentation showing how work is performed
- Customer testimonials with verifiable names/businesses
- Before/after comparisons
- Video content showing actual work being done
- Published project galleries

## Expertise (E2) — Weight: 25%

Measures demonstrated depth of knowledge and professional qualifications.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | No credentials mentioned. Content lacks depth — surface-level information only. No evidence the author/business has specialized knowledge. |
| 3-4 | Basic credentials mentioned (e.g., "licensed and insured") but not substantiated. Content is generic and could apply to any market. |
| 5-6 | Relevant credentials displayed (license numbers, certifications). Content shows moderate depth with some industry-specific details. |
| 7-8 | Strong expertise signals. Specific certifications displayed with verification links. Content demonstrates deep knowledge (technical details, industry data, nuanced explanations). Educational content published. |
| 9-10 | Leading expertise. Industry certifications prominently displayed. Published original research or guides. Staff bios with individual qualifications. Training/continuing education mentioned. Content answers complex questions with specificity. |

**Signals to evaluate:**
- Professional licenses with verifiable numbers
- Industry certifications (manufacturer-specific, trade-specific)
- Staff/team bios with individual qualifications
- Educational content depth (guides, how-tos, explainers)
- Industry-specific terminology used correctly
- Pricing transparency with explanation of factors
- Technical accuracy of claims

## Authoritativeness (A) — Weight: 25%

Measures external recognition and validation by others in the field.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | No external recognition. No reviews, no citations, no mentions by other sites. Business is invisible to the broader ecosystem. |
| 3-4 | Minimal authority. A few reviews (< 25), listed in some directories but no notable mentions. No press, no awards. |
| 5-6 | Moderate authority. 25-100 reviews with 4.0+ rating. Listed in major directories. Some local citations. May have 1-2 local press mentions. |
| 7-8 | Strong authority. 100+ reviews, 4.5+ rating. Consistent citations across 30+ directories. Local press mentions. Industry association membership. BBB accredited. Some backlinks from relevant sites. |
| 9-10 | Market authority. 200+ reviews, 4.7+ rating. 50+ consistent citations. Press features, awards, industry recognition. Featured in local publications. Backlink profile from relevant, authoritative domains. Mentioned by other businesses as a reference. |

**Signals to evaluate:**
- Review volume and average rating (Google, Yelp, industry-specific)
- Citation count and consistency (NAP accuracy)
- Backlink profile (DR/DA, relevance of linking domains)
- Press mentions and media coverage
- Industry awards and recognition
- Association memberships
- BBB accreditation and rating
- Mentions in "best of" lists by independent sources

## Trustworthiness (T) — Weight: 30%

The foundational signal. Google states this is the most important E-E-A-T component. Measures how safe, honest, and reliable the site and business are.

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 0-2 | Major trust issues. No HTTPS, no contact information, no physical address, no privacy policy. Deceptive content or hidden costs. Reviews suggest dishonesty. |
| 3-4 | Basic trust elements missing. HTTPS present but no privacy policy, incomplete contact info, or inconsistent NAP across web. Reviews mention trust concerns. |
| 5-6 | Adequate trust signals. HTTPS, privacy policy, terms of service, contact page with phone/email/address. NAP mostly consistent. Responds to some reviews. |
| 7-8 | Strong trust signals. All legal pages present. Full NAP consistency. Active review response (70%+). Transparent pricing. Clear service guarantees. SSL current. Accessibility basics met. |
| 9-10 | Exceptional trust. All of the above plus: verified business credentials on site, transparent ownership, detailed service guarantees, active dispute resolution, 90%+ review response rate, published cancellation/refund policies, security badges, accessibility compliance. |

**Signals to evaluate:**
- HTTPS with valid, current SSL certificate
- Privacy policy (present, accessible, current)
- Terms of service
- Physical address displayed (matches GBP)
- Phone number displayed (matches GBP)
- Contact form functional
- NAP consistency across all platforms
- Review response rate and quality
- Pricing transparency
- Service guarantees or warranties
- Refund/cancellation policies
- Business registration/license verification links
- Accessibility (basic WCAG compliance)

## Composite Score Interpretation

| E-E-A-T Score | Interpretation | CATALYST Impact |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 0.0 - 2.0 | Critical E-E-A-T deficiency | Elevate to Tier 1 priority. Major trust/credibility barriers. |
| 2.1 - 4.0 | Weak E-E-A-T presence | Tier 1-2 priority. Foundational work needed on trust and credentials. |
| 4.1 - 6.0 | Developing E-E-A-T | Tier 2-3 priority. Build out experience proof and authority signals. |
| 6.1 - 8.0 | Strong E-E-A-T | Tier 3-4 priority. Fine-tune and expand existing signals. |
| 8.1 - 10.0 | Excellent E-E-A-T | Maintenance mode. Focus on freshness and continuous review generation. |

## YMYL Adjustment

For businesses in YMYL categories (health, finance, legal, safety), apply a **1.5x weight multiplier to Trustworthiness** and normalize:

```
YMYL Composite = (E1 * 0.17) + (E2 * 0.21) + (A * 0.21) + (T * 0.41)
```

YMYL categories relevant to local businesses: medical/dental practices, financial advisors, legal services, home services involving safety (electrical, HVAC, plumbing), childcare, elder care.
