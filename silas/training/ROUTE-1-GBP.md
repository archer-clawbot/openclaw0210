## SPEC-001: GBP SERVICES

### Core Concept
Every custom service entry is a micro-landing page, not a keyword stub. Detailed service entries match high-intent long-tail queries and trigger "justification snippets" in the Local Pack.

### Procedure
1. Research client's full service catalog + competitor service entries
2. For each service, write a detailed description (300-1,000 characters) that:
   - Names the specific service in the first sentence
   - Describes what the service includes
   - Mentions the outcome/benefit to the customer
   - Includes geographic modifiers naturally
   - Reads like a mini sales page, not a keyword list
3. Group services into logical categories (max 10 categories recommended)
4. Add pricing where appropriate (price transparency = higher CTR)

### Template
```
Service Name: [Specific Long-Tail Service Name]
Category: [Service Category]
Description: [Business Name] provides [specific service] for [target customer] 
in [city/area]. Our [service] includes [specific details of what's included]. 
[Outcome statement]. [Credential or trust signal]. Serving [neighborhoods/areas].
Price: [Range or "Contact for quote"]
```

### Scoring (0-10)
- 0: No custom services
- 3: Generic keyword-only services
- 5: Some detailed, some generic
- 7: All services detailed with descriptions
- 10: Every service is a micro-landing page targeting high-intent long-tails

## SPEC-002: GBP DESCRIPTION ENGINEERING

### Core Concept — The "Local Hub Gambit"
The 750-character GBP description uses entity co-citations to signal that the business is a connected local hub, not an isolated listing. Mentioning verifiable local entities (suppliers, associations, landmarks, builders) creates semantic relationships that Google validates.

### Structure (750 characters max)
```
[Opening identity statement with primary keyword + city]
[Entity co-citation #1 — local supplier, partner, or association]
[Entity co-citation #2 — landmark, neighborhood, or institution]
[Core services with specific details]
[Credential/trust signals — years, certifications, awards]
[Service area with specific neighborhoods]
[Closing CTA]
```

### Entity Co-Citation Categories
- **Suppliers/Partners:** Local suppliers the business actually uses (verifiable)
- **Professional Associations:** Chamber of Commerce, industry groups, BBB
- **Geographic Anchors:** Landmarks, neighborhoods, shopping centers, highways
- **Complementary Businesses:** Other local businesses that serve same customers

### Rules
- Every entity mentioned MUST be real and verifiable by Google
- Never fabricate relationships — Google cross-checks
- Front-load the primary keyword + city in the first sentence
- No phone numbers, URLs, or promotional language in description
- Write in third person ("Business Name provides..." not "We provide...")

### Scoring (0-10)
- 0: Empty or auto-generated
- 3: Basic description, no entity co-citations
- 5: Keyword-optimized but missing authority signals
- 7: Entity co-citations + credentials + geo-modifiers
- 10: Full Local Hub Gambit with 3+ verifiable entity co-citations

## SPEC-003: GBP Q&A PRE-EMPTION

### Core Concept
Seed 15-30 Q&A entries before customers ask random questions. Each answer is a keyword-dense content block that Google indexes and uses for relevance signals.

### Procedure
1. Generate questions from keyword research (what people actually search)
2. Write comprehensive answers (150-500 characters each)
3. Post questions from a Google account, then answer as the business owner
4. Include natural keyword variations in answers
5. For complex topics, link to a Google Doc "answer funnel" (public doc with detailed guide)

### Question Categories
- **Service-specific:** "Do you offer [specific service] in [city]?"
- **Pricing:** "How much does [service] cost?"
- **Process:** "What's the process for [service]?"
- **Credentials:** "Are you licensed/insured/certified for [service]?"
- **Area:** "Do you serve [neighborhood/city]?"
- **Comparison:** "What's the difference between [option A] and [option B]?"

### Answer Template
```
Q: [Question matching a real search query]
A: Yes, [Business Name] offers [service] in [city/area]. [2-3 sentences with 
specific details — pricing, process, timeline, or qualifications]. 
[For more details: link to Google Doc guide if applicable]. 
Contact us at [phone] to [CTA].
```

### Google Docs Answer Funnel
For complex questions that exceed Q&A character limits:
1. Create a comprehensive Google Doc (2,000+ words, publicly viewable)
2. Link from Q&A answer: "We created a free guide: [Doc link]"
3. This creates a Google-to-Google trust signal (GBP → Google Docs)

### Scoring (0-10)
- 0: No Q&A entries
- 3: Few generic Q&A, thin answers
- 5: 10-15 entries, moderate keyword density
- 7: 20+ entries, comprehensive answers, all service areas covered
- 10: 30+ entries with answer funnels, covering every service + area + FAQ

## SPEC-004: GBP PRODUCTS TAB

### Core Concept
Products tab is a visual conversion tool. Each product entry has an image, description, price, and CTA button — functioning as a visual menu of offerings.

### Procedure
1. Create product collections (categories) matching service categories
2. For each product/service:
   - Professional image (real photos preferred over stock)
   - Descriptive title (service name, not generic)
   - Detailed description (features, benefits, what's included)
   - Price or price range
   - CTA button (Call, Learn More, Book)
3. Prioritize highest-margin or most-searched services first

### Template
```
Collection: [Service Category]
Product Name: [Specific Service Name]
Description: [What it includes, who it's for, key benefit, timeframe]
Price: $X,XXX or $X,XXX - $X,XXX or "Request Quote"
CTA: [Call / Learn More / Book Online]
Image: [Professional photo of this service in action]
```

### Scoring (0-10)
- 0: Products tab empty
- 3: Few products, no images or descriptions
- 5: Products listed but generic descriptions
- 7: All services as products with images and descriptions
- 10: Complete product catalog with professional images, pricing, compelling descriptions

## SPEC-005: GBP POSTING STRATEGY

### Core Concept — Pre-Emptive Framing
Posts seed content into Google's index and AI systems. The strategy isn't promotional — it's about framing the business as the authority in its market by defining what quality means, then demonstrating the business meets those criteria.

### Cadence
3 posts per week minimum. Schedule:
- **Monday:** Service/expertise highlight
- **Wednesday:** Community/local engagement
- **Friday:** Offer, event, or seasonal content

### Post Types & Templates
**Service Highlight:**
```
[Service Name] in [City] — What to Know in [Year]

[2-3 sentences positioning the business as expert on this service. 
Include specific details: pricing, process, timeline.]

[Credential or trust signal.]

📞 [Phone] | 🌐 [Website]
```

**Pre-Emptive Framing Post:**
```
When choosing a [service provider] in [city], look for:
✅ [Credential your client has]
✅ [Feature your client offers]
✅ [Trust signal your client possesses]

[Business Name] meets all three — [brief proof statement].
```

**Community Post:**
```
[Business Name] is proud to [support/partner with/attend] [local event/organization].
[1-2 sentences about the connection.]
[Tag or mention the local entity for co-citation.]
```

### Rules
- Every post must include a CTA (call, visit, book)
- Include at least one geo-modifier per post
- Vary keywords across posts (don't repeat the same keyword every post)
- Include a photo with every post (real > stock)
- Never use GBP posts for link building or thin content

### Scoring (0-10)
- 0: No posts or last post > 30 days ago
- 3: Sporadic posting, generic content
- 5: 1-2 posts/week, some keyword optimization
- 7: 3/week, pre-emptive framing, local entity mentions
- 10: 3+/week, full framing strategy, consistent for 3+ months
