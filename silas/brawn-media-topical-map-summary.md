## 🎯 THE OPPORTUNITY

Brawn Media is positioned in a competitive Albany market with strong differentiators (WBE certification, MARCOM awards, full-service capability) but lacks comprehensive organic visibility.

**Current State:**
- ❌ No rankings for key service + location keywords
- ❌ Limited industry-specific content
- ❌ Geographic reach limited to Albany (missing Saratoga, Capital District)
- ✅ Strong blog (40+ pages)
- ✅ Award-winning reputation
- ✅ Proprietary tool (BrawnGuard)

**Competitive Gap:**
Local competitors (Overit, Media Logic, Advance Media NY) dominate search results but lack:
- AI-first SEO content
- Industry-specific expertise pages
- Comprehensive educational resources
- Women-owned positioning
