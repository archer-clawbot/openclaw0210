# SPEC-018: Cross-Platform AI Ecosystem Optimization
## Silas Engine — AI/Cross-Platform Group
### Version 1.0 | AI & Cross-Platform Optimization

---

## 1. PURPOSE

This specification defines Silas's methodology for building cross-platform content ecosystems that amplify a client's authority across every platform that AI systems crawl, index, and trust. While SPEC-017 focuses on direct LLM optimization, this spec addresses the upstream problem: creating the multi-platform content and presence that makes a business the "consensus answer" across the entire information ecosystem.

From the CATALYST methodology: "You're not just creating content; you're building a verifiable knowledge asset that exists across the entire information ecosystem that AI systems crawl and trust."

**Core principle:** "AI systems validate by consensus. The business that appears consistently across the most trusted platforms wins."

## 3. THE CONTENT DISTRIBUTION PIPELINE

### 3.1 Pipeline Architecture

Every piece of content flows through a structured distribution pipeline:

```
Core Research & Content Creation
         │
         ▼
  NotebookLM (Testing & Google Ecosystem Seeding)
         │
         ▼
  Website (Canonical Source — SPEC-006/007/010)
         │
         ├──► YouTube (Audio/Video)
         ├──► Google Business Profile (Posts/Q&A)
         ├──► Social Media (Facebook/Instagram/LinkedIn)
         ├──► Google Docs (Authority Bridge)
         ├──► Parasite SEO Platforms (Medium, LinkedIn Articles)
         └──► Industry Directories & Forums
```

### 3.2 Platform Roles

| Platform | Role in Ecosystem | AI Systems That Crawl It |
|----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Client Website | Canonical hub — authoritative source of truth | All (Google, Bing, Perplexity, ChatGPT) |
| Google Business Profile | Local entity anchor + micro-content | Google AI Overviews, Gemini |
| YouTube | Audio/video content + rich transcripts | Google, Perplexity, ChatGPT (browsing) |
| Google Docs | Google-ecosystem authority bridge | Gemini, Google AI Overviews |
| NotebookLM | AI training feed within Google's infrastructure | Gemini (high trust) |
| Facebook | Social proof + local community presence | ChatGPT (training data), Perplexity |
| Instagram | Visual content + local engagement | Training data for multiple LLMs |
| LinkedIn | Professional authority + B2B visibility | Copilot, ChatGPT (training data) |
| Medium / LinkedIn Articles | Long-form parasite content | All search-based LLMs |
| Reddit | Community presence + discussion authority | ChatGPT (significant training source) |
| Yelp | Review authority node | Apple Intelligence, Siri |
| Apple Maps (Business Connect) | Apple ecosystem presence | Apple Intelligence, Siri |
| Bing Places | Microsoft ecosystem presence | Copilot, ChatGPT (browsing mode) |
| GitHub | Technical authority (if applicable) | ChatGPT (significant training source) |

### 3.3 Cross-Platform Authority Validation

Why this pipeline works for AI:

```
1. CONSENSUS SIGNAL:
   Google's AI sees the same core information appearing across multiple 
   trusted platforms. Each platform serves as an independent verification 
   node. This creates a consensus signal that the information is reliable.

2. MULTI-MODAL COVERAGE:
   Audio (YouTube) + Text (Website) + Interactive (NotebookLM) + Code (GitHub)
   This covers all the ways AI systems consume and understand content,
   making information retrievable through multiple channels.

3. THE "FRESHNESS CASCADE" EFFECT:
   - Update core content on the website
   - It automatically updates across NotebookLM
   - YouTube and GitHub show recent activity
   - This signals current relevance to AI systems
```

---

## 4. YOUTUBE OPTIMIZATION FOR LOCAL SEO

### 4.1 Why YouTube Matters

YouTube is the second-largest search engine and a primary content source for Google's AI systems. For local businesses, YouTube provides:
- Video results in Google search (including local queries)
- Rich transcript data that AI systems extract and cite
- YouTube-specific search queries ("how much does X cost in [city]")
- Multi-modal content signals (audio + visual + text)

### 4.2 Video Content Strategy for Local Businesses

**Content types ranked by impact:**

| Content Type | Example | Search Value | Production Effort |
|-------------|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cost/Pricing guides | "AC Coil Replacement Cost Fort Lauderdale 2026" | Very High | Medium |
| How-to / Educational | "How to Choose a Plumber in Fort Lauderdale" | High | Medium |
| Project showcases | "Complete Kitchen Renovation — Coral Ridge Home" | Medium | Low |
| FAQ compilations | "Top 10 Questions About Roof Repair" | High | Low |
| Area guides | "Best Neighborhoods in Fort Lauderdale for Families" | Medium | Medium |
| Behind-the-scenes | "Day in the Life of a Fort Lauderdale HVAC Tech" | Low-Medium | Low |
| Emergency guides | "What to Do When Your AC Breaks at 2 AM" | Medium | Low |

### 4.3 Video Title Engineering

**Formula:** Primary Keyword + Location + Year + Price/Value Hook

```
Examples:
✅ "AC Evaporator Coil Replacement Cost Fort Lauderdale 2026 | $1,800 - $4,300"
✅ "Emergency Roof Repair Fort Lauderdale | What to Expect & What It Costs"
✅ "Best Plumber in Sugar Land TX — How to Choose (2026 Guide)"

❌ "We Fix ACs! Call Us Today!" (no search value)
❌ "Our Latest Project" (no keywords)
❌ "HVAC Tips" (too generic, no location)
```

**Title character targets:**
- YouTube display: 60 characters visible in search
- Full title: up to 100 characters
- Primary keyword: within first 50 characters
- Location: always include city name

### 4.4 Video Description Optimization

The description is a critical content field that AI systems extract heavily.

**Structure template:**

```
[First 150 characters — the "above the fold" preview]
Direct answer to the video's core question with specific numbers and location.

📞 CONTACT INFORMATION
[Business Name]: [Phone Number]
Website: [URL]
Location: [Full Address]

⏱️ VIDEO CHAPTERS
0:00 - [Chapter Title]
0:32 - [Chapter Title]
1:15 - [Chapter Title]
[Continue for all sections]

💵 DETAILED INFORMATION
[2-3 paragraphs of keyword-rich content that expands on the video topic.
Include specific prices, service details, qualifications, and local information.
This section should read as a standalone resource.]

🏠 ABOUT [BUSINESS NAME]
[Company bio paragraph with credentials, years in business, service area,
and key differentiators. Include all NAP data.]

📍 SERVICE AREA
[List of specific cities, neighborhoods, and counties served]

🔍 RELATED SEARCH TERMS
[10-15 long-tail keywords related to the video topic]

[5-10 relevant hashtags]
```

### 4.5 Technical Video Optimization

| Element | Specification |
|---------|--------------|
| Filename | Keyword-rich with hyphens: `ac-coil-replacement-cost-fort-lauderdale-2026.mp4` |
| Resolution | 4K (3840×2160) preferred; 1080p minimum |
| Aspect ratio | 16:9 (standard YouTube) |
| Frame rate | 30fps (tutorials), 60fps (action/demo) |
| Thumbnail filename | `keyword-city-year-thumbnail.jpg` |
| Transcript/captions | Upload .srt file separately with keyword optimization |
| Tags | Primary (3-5), secondary (5-8), long-tail (5-10), geographic (3-5) |
| End screens | Link to website service page + related video |
| Cards | Link to Google Maps location + service page at relevant timestamps |
| Playlist | Group related videos: "[City] [Industry] Guide" |

### 4.6 Thumbnail Design Psychology

**Template:**

```
Layout:
├── Left 50%: Professional photo (technician, completed work, before/after)
├── Right 50%: Bold text overlay
│   ├── Top line: SERVICE NAME (caps, white text)
│   ├── Middle line: $X,XXX (large, yellow/green text)
│   └── Bottom line: CITY NAME YEAR (smaller, accent color)
└── Corner badge: Credential/trust signal icon

Color psychology:
- Background: Dark blue (trust, professionalism)
- Price text: Bright yellow (attention, urgency)
- Accents: Red (importance) or green (positive/savings)
- Credibility badge: White/gold (quality, premium)
```

### 4.7 YouTube-to-Website Link Strategy

```
Every YouTube video must link to:
1. Corresponding service page on client website (primary CTA)
2. Google Maps listing (direction requests signal)
3. GBP profile (increases GBP interactions)
4. Related YouTube videos (playlist engagement)

Every service page on client website must embed:
1. The corresponding YouTube video
2. Structured VideoObject schema (SPEC-008)
3. Transcript below the video (crawlable text content)
```

### 4.8 Silas YouTube Content Workflow

```
For each client service page:
1. Generate video script from service page content
   - Lead with the direct answer (cost, process, timeline)
   - Include local-specific information
   - End with CTA to call/visit
   
2. Generate optimized metadata:
   - Title (keyword + location + year + hook)
   - Description (full template from §4.4)
   - Tags (25-30, categorized)
   - Thumbnail brief
   - Chapter timestamps
   - Transcript with keyword density targets
   
3. Generate distribution package:
   - Script for recording
   - Metadata for upload
   - Embed code for website
   - VideoObject schema markup
   - GBP post promoting the video
```

## 5. GOOGLE ECOSYSTEM OPTIMIZATION

### 5.1 Google Docs as Authority Bridges

From the CATALYST "Answer Funnel" tactic:

```
Use case: Complex questions that can't be fully answered in GBP Q&A

Implementation:
1. Create a comprehensive Google Doc (2,000+ words)
   - Title: The exact question the user would ask
   - Content: Exhaustive answer with images, checklists, tables
   - Links: Back to client service pages
   - Sharing: "Anyone with the link can view"

2. Reference in GBP Q&A:
   Q: "What is the entire insurance claim process for [service] after [event]?"
   A: "Great question. In short: 1) Get inspection, 2) File claim, 
       3) Meet adjuster, 4) Get work done. For a complete guide, 
       we created a free resource: [Link to Google Doc]"

3. AI impact:
   - Click signal from GBP → Google Docs (Google-to-Google trust)
   - Massive keyword depth (far exceeds Q&A character limits)
   - Positions business as authoritative resource creator
   - Doc is crawlable and can appear in search results
```

### 5.2 NotebookLM Integration

```
For each major content piece:
1. Upload to NotebookLM:
   - Service guides
   - Pricing breakdowns
   - How-to content
   - FAQ compilations

2. Benefits:
   - Content processed within Google's AI infrastructure
   - Creates training data directly accessible to Gemini
   - Audio summary generation (additional content format)
   - Internal cross-referencing builds entity strength

3. Cadence: Upload new/updated content monthly
```

### 5.3 Google Maps Ecosystem

Beyond basic GBP optimization, leverage the full Maps ecosystem:

```
Google Maps contributions:
- Client posts photos to own listing (tagged/geotagged)
- Encourage customers to post user photos (higher trust score)
- Answer community questions on Google Maps
- Update "popular times" data (engagement signal)

Google Maps CID link usage:
- Use the CID link for expired domain redirects (SPEC-013)
- Include CID link in schema markup
- Reference in directory submissions

Google Local Guides strategy:
- Monitor Local Guides reviews and questions about client
- Respond to all Local Guides interactions (higher weight)
```

## 6. SECONDARY PLATFORM OPTIMIZATION

### 6.1 Bing Places (Critical for ChatGPT/Copilot)

```
Setup:
1. Claim Bing Places listing
2. Import from Google Business Profile (Bing offers this)
3. Verify all NAP data matches exactly
4. Add all services, hours, photos
5. Submit to Bing Webmaster Tools

Ongoing:
- Update monthly (sync with GBP changes)
- Monitor Bing search results for client keywords
- Bing indexes differently than Google — some opportunities exist only here
```

### 6.2 Apple Business Connect (Critical for Siri/Apple Intelligence)

```
Setup:
1. Claim listing at business.apple.com
2. Verify business ownership
3. Add all details: name, address, phone, hours, categories
4. Upload high-quality photos
5. Add showcase items (equivalent to GBP products)
6. Connect to Yelp for review data

Ongoing:
- Update whenever business details change
- Apple Maps has different category taxonomy — optimize accordingly
- Monitor Apple Maps search for client keywords
```

### 6.3 Yelp Optimization

```
Why Yelp matters:
- Primary review data source for Apple Intelligence/Siri
- Strong domain authority (appears in organic search)
- LLMs frequently cite Yelp reviews in responses

Optimization:
1. Claim and fully optimize Yelp listing
2. Respond to all reviews (positive and negative)
3. Add photos, services, hours, specialties
4. Encourage Yelp reviews (but carefully — Yelp filters aggressively)
5. Maintain response rate >90%
```

### 6.4 Reddit Presence (Critical for ChatGPT Training Data)

Reddit is one of the largest training data sources for ChatGPT and other LLMs.

```
Strategy (organic, not promotional):
1. Identify relevant local subreddits (r/[city], r/[industry])
2. Monitor for questions about client's service category
3. Provide genuinely helpful answers (not promotional)
4. Build account karma and credibility over time
5. When appropriate, mention client naturally:
   "When my AC broke, I used [Business Name] and they were there in 2 hours"
   
Caution:
- Never spam or overtly promote
- Reddit users are hostile to marketing
- Build genuine community presence first
- This is a long-term play (months to show results)
- Consider whether the effort justifies the return for each client
```

### 6.5 LinkedIn Optimization (B2B + Professional Authority)

```
Company page:
- Complete profile with all services and specialties
- Regular posts (1-2/week) sharing industry expertise
- Employee profiles linked to company page
- Recommendations and endorsements

LinkedIn Articles:
- Republish top website content as LinkedIn Articles
- Reach professional audience
- LinkedIn content appears in Bing/Copilot results
- Additional backlink to website
```

### 6.6 Social Media Presence (Facebook/Instagram)

```
Facebook:
- Claim and optimize business page
- Post regularly (2-3/week)
- Encourage Facebook reviews (separate review signal)
- Use Facebook Events for local engagement
- Facebook data feeds Meta AI

Instagram:
- Post project photos, before/after, team content
- Use location tags on every post
- Geo-tagged content strengthens local entity signals
- Reels for short-form content (reuse YouTube clips)
```

## 7. PARASITE SEO FOR AI VISIBILITY

### 7.1 What Is Parasite SEO?

Publishing content on high-authority third-party platforms to leverage their domain authority and crawl frequency. These platforms rank quickly and are frequently included in LLM training data.

### 7.2 Platform Priorities

| Platform | Domain Authority | LLM Training Source | Content Type |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------|
| Medium | Very High | Yes (ChatGPT, Perplexity) | Long-form articles |
| LinkedIn Articles | Very High | Yes (Copilot, ChatGPT) | Professional content |
| Quora | High | Yes (multiple LLMs) | Q&A responses |
| YouTube | Very High | Yes (all LLMs) | Video (covered in §4) |
| Google Docs (public) | Very High | Yes (Gemini) | Guides, checklists |
| GitHub Pages | High | Yes (ChatGPT) | Technical content |

### 7.3 Parasite Content Strategy

```
For each major client service:
1. Create definitive content on client website (canonical)
2. Republish adapted version on Medium
   - Different title, restructured content (avoid duplicate penalties)
   - Link back to client website as "original source"
3. Create LinkedIn Article version
   - Professional angle, shorter form
   - CTA to website for full details
4. Answer related Quora questions
   - Link to website for comprehensive answer
5. Monitor which parasite content ranks and generates traffic

Key rule: Website is always the canonical source. 
Parasite content always links back to it.
```

## 9. CROSS-PLATFORM CONSISTENCY RULES

### 9.1 Information That Must Be Identical Everywhere

| Data Point | Platforms | Tolerance |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Business name | All | Zero — exact match |
| Address | All | Zero — exact match (same abbreviation style) |
| Phone number | All | Zero — same format everywhere |
| Hours of operation | All | Zero — update everywhere simultaneously |
| Primary service category | All | Zero — same primary category |
| Website URL | All | Zero — same URL (including/excluding www) |

### 9.2 Information That Should Be Consistent but Can Vary

| Data Point | Acceptable Variation | Limit |
|-----------|---------------------|-------|
| Business description | Platform-appropriate length/tone | Core facts must match |
| Service list | Platform-appropriate formatting | All services mentioned somewhere |
| Photos | Different photos per platform | Brand-consistent quality |
| Posts/updates | Unique per platform | Same promotional calendar |
| Review responses | Unique per review | Consistent tone/brand voice |

### 9.3 Cross-Platform Update Protocol

- Generate update task list for all platforms
- Track completion status
- Verify consistency after all updates complete
```

## 10. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC AI SIGNALS

### 10.1 The "Freshness Cascade"

When content is updated, the freshness signal cascades across platforms:

```
Day 1: Update core content on website
Day 1: GBP post announcing/reflecting the update
Day 2: YouTube video with updated information
Day 2: Social media posts referencing the change
Day 3: NotebookLM content refresh
Day 7: Medium article with updated perspective

Result: AI systems see "recent activity" across 6+ platforms within a week,
dramatically boosting recency signals for the next training data crawl.
```

### 10.2 Cross-Platform Citation Web

Every platform presence should reference other presences:

```
Website → links to GBP, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Yelp, BBB
GBP → links to website, YouTube channel, appointment URL
YouTube → links to website, Google Maps, GBP in every description
Facebook → links to website, YouTube, Instagram
LinkedIn → links to website, YouTube, company projects
Medium → links to website (canonical), YouTube
Schema markup → sameAs array listing ALL platform URLs
```

This creates a web of cross-references that AI systems use to build entity confidence. When the same business appears connected across 10+ platforms with mutual references, entity confidence approaches certainty.

## 11. SILAS CROSS-PLATFORM AUTOMATION

### 11.1 Platform Presence Audit

```
For each new client:
1. Check presence on all target platforms:
   ☐ Google Business Profile → claimed and optimized?
   ☐ Website → exists with proper schema?
   ☐ YouTube → channel exists?
   ☐ Facebook → business page exists?
   ☐ Instagram → business profile exists?
   ☐ LinkedIn → company page exists?
   ☐ Yelp → claimed and optimized?
   ☐ Apple Business Connect → claimed?
   ☐ Bing Places → claimed?
   ☐ Better Business Bureau → listed?
   ☐ Industry-specific directories → listed?

2. For each unclaimed/missing platform:
   a. Generate setup instructions
   b. Prepare content (descriptions, photos, categories)
   c. Add to setup task list
   
3. For each existing but unoptimized platform:
   a. Audit current content against standards
   b. Generate optimized content
   c. Add to optimization task list

4. Score overall platform coverage: [X] / [Total] = [%]
```

### 11.2 Content Distribution Automation

```
When a new service page is published (or updated):
1. Generate derivative content:
   ├── YouTube: Script + metadata package
   ├── GBP: 4 posts for weekly distribution
   ├── Medium: Adapted article
   ├── LinkedIn: Professional version
   ├── Social: 5-8 posts across Facebook/Instagram
   ├── Q&A: 3-5 GBP Q&A entries
   └── Google Doc: Expanded guide

2. Generate distribution schedule:
   - Map content to weekly calendar slots
   - Stagger releases for maximum freshness cascade
   
3. Track distribution status:
   - ☐ Published vs. ☐ Pending for each platform
   - Verify cross-links between platforms
   - Confirm NAP consistency in all new content
```

### 11.3 Cross-Platform Health Monitor

```
Monthly cross-platform audit:
1. NAP consistency check across all platforms
2. Content freshness check (last update date per platform)
3. Review response rate across platforms
4. Broken link detection (cross-platform references)
5. Photo currency (outdated photos on any platform?)
6. Category/service alignment across platforms

Output: Platform Health Scorecard
- Green (90-100%): Consistent, fresh, complete
- Yellow (70-89%): Minor issues, needs attention
- Red (<70%): Critical gaps, immediate action required
```
