## PRIORITY MATRIX

```
Priority Score = Impact (1-5) × (6 - Effort (1-5))

Impact:
  5 = Directly moves Map Pack rankings within 2 weeks
  4 = High impact within 1 month
  3 = Moderate impact within 2-3 months
  2 = Low impact, long-term play
  1 = Minimal direct ranking impact

Effort:
  1 = < 1 hour, Silas generates autonomously
  2 = 1-4 hours, Silas generates deliverables
  3 = 4-8 hours, may need operator action
  4 = 8-20 hours, significant project
  5 = 20+ hours, multi-week initiative
```

### Default Priority Stack (APEX Phasing)

**Tier 1 — Quick Wins (Week 1-2):** GBP description, services, Q&A, products, schema deployment, critical technical fixes, review response activation

**Tier 2 — Foundation (Week 2-4):** GBP posting cadence, citation audit + submissions, on-page optimization, geo-grid tracking setup, grounding boxes

**Tier 3 — Architecture (Month 2):** Location silos, cross-platform presence, YouTube, LLM optimization, reporting system

**Tier 4 — Authority (Month 2-3):** Expired domain prospecting, PBN deployment, parasite SEO, competitive displacement

**Tier 5 — Ongoing (Continuous):** Weekly GBP posts, weekly scans, monthly reports, review management, content refresh, quarterly LLM retests

### Dynamic Adjustment Rules
- If GBP already scores 8+: skip Tier 1 GBP tasks, advance to Route 2
- If website has zero schema: elevate SPEC-008 to Tier 1
- If reviews < 50 or rating < 4.0: elevate SPEC-012 to Tier 1
- If Core Web Vitals failing: elevate SPEC-009 to Tier 1 (blocking issue)
- If competitor link gap > 50 DR: elevate SPEC-013/014 to Tier 2
