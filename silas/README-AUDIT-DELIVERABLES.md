## ❓ QUESTIONS?

**"Why isn't the site indexed?"**  
→ Site is very new + no backlinks. Google hasn't discovered it yet. Submitting sitemap will fix this.

**"How long until we see traffic?"**  
→ 7-14 days to get indexed, 30 days to see measurable organic traffic.

**"Can we do this in-house?"**  
→ Yes. All Week 1 fixes are DIY with Rank Math. Weeks 2-4 may need a contractor.

**"Should we hire an agency?"**  
→ No need. The plan is clear, tasks are straightforward, and you have the content already.

**"What if we don't have time for this?"**  
→ Prioritize Week 1 (90 min). That alone unlocks indexation and starts organic traffic flow.
