| **BBB** | MCC Electric Inc. | Roselle, IL 60172 | Not displayed |

### 🔴 Critical NAP Issues

**1. Domain Name ≠ Business Name**
- Domain: "chicagoselectrician.com"
- Business Name: "MCC Electric"
- **Impact:** Creates entity confusion for Google. Domain implies a different brand.

**2. Phone Number Discrepancy**
- Manta listing shows (224) 653-9280 (different from all other sources)
- **Action Required:** Claim and update Manta listing, or request removal if outdated

**3. Multiple Locations, Inconsistent Presentation**
- 4 distinct locations (Roselle, Chicago, Schaumburg, Des Plaines)
- Roselle location has duplicate listings
- Des Plaines Yelp listing shows different address than any GBP

**4. "Inc." Suffix Inconsistency**
- BBB uses "MCC Electric Inc."
- All GBP listings use "MCC Electric" (no Inc.)
- **Best Practice:** Choose one format and apply everywhere

### ✅ NAP Consistency Recommendations

#### IMMEDIATE (Week 1)
1. **Merge/Remove Duplicate Roselle GBP Listing**
   - Keep: 4.9★ / 73 reviews listing (stronger authority)
   - Mark for removal: 4.6★ / 16 reviews listing
   - Process: Use "Suggest an edit" → "Mark as duplicate" in GMB dashboard
   - **Expected Timeline:** 2-3 weeks for Google to process

2. **Standardize Business Name**
   - **Recommended Format:** "MCC Electric" (current GBP standard)
   - Update BBB to remove "Inc." suffix (or add to all listings if legally required)
   - Update all citations to exact match: "MCC Electric"

3. **Audit & Update Manta Listing**
   - Claim listing at https://www.manta.com/c/mhbycjk/mcc-electric
   - Update phone to (847) 401-8393
   - Verify address format matches GBP exactly

4. **Verify Des Plaines Location**
   - Yelp shows 380 E Northwest Hwy, Des Plaines
   - No corresponding GBP listing found
   - **Action:** Determine if this is an old/closed location → suppress listing if inactive

#### ONGOING
5. **Citation Audit Across Top 50 Directories**
   - Use BrightLocal or Whitespark to scan for inconsistencies
   - Priority directories: Yelp, YP.com, BBB, Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Facebook
   - **Target:** 95%+ NAP consistency across all citations

## 2. GBP LISTING INVENTORY

### Active Listings Identified

| Listing | Status | Reviews | Rating | Hours | URL |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|-------|-----|
| **MCC Electric (Roselle #1)** | ✅ Active (PRIMARY) | 73 | 4.9★ | Open 24 hours | [Maps Link] |
| **MCC Electric (Roselle #2)** | 🔴 DUPLICATE | 16 | 4.6★ | Closes 5 PM | [Maps Link] |
| **MCC Electric (Chicago)** | ⚠️ No Reviews | 0 | N/A | Closes 7 PM | [Maps Link] |
| **MCC Electric Schaumburg** | ⚠️ No Reviews | 0 | N/A | Open 24 hours | [Maps Link] |

### 🔴 URGENT: Duplicate Listing Problem

**The Issue:**
- Two GBP listings exist for 376 Monaco Drive, Roselle
- Same business, same address, different:
  - Review counts (73 vs 16)
  - Star ratings (4.9 vs 4.6)
  - Business hours (24/7 vs 9am-5pm)

**The Impact:**
- **Review Equity Dilution:** 89 total reviews split across 2 listings instead of 89 on one authoritative listing
- **Ranking Confusion:** Google doesn't know which listing is canonical → both rank lower than a unified listing would
- **Customer Confusion:** Different hours/ratings create trust issues
- **Wasted Link Equity:** External citations may point to either listing, fragmenting authority

**The Solution:**
1. Access GMB dashboard for BOTH listings
2. Identify which listing has better review velocity (likely the 4.9★ / 73 review listing)
3. In the weaker listing (4.6★ / 16 reviews), click "Info" → "Mark as duplicate"
4. Select the stronger listing as the primary
5. Google will merge data over 2-3 weeks
6. **Critical:** Do NOT delete the weaker listing — always use "mark as duplicate" to preserve review history

**Expected Outcome:**
- Single GBP listing with ~89 combined reviews
- Unified 4.8-4.9★ rating
- Consolidated ranking signals
- Estimated ranking improvement: +15-25% in Map Pack visibility within 30 days post-merge

## 5. CATEGORY OPTIMIZATION

### Current Primary Category
**Electrician** ✅ (Correct for core business)

### Recommended Secondary Categories (Max 9 Additional)

**High-Priority (Add Immediately):**
1. **Emergency electrician service** — Captures "emergency electrician near me" searches
2. **Electrical installation service** — Broad commercial/residential installations
3. **Lighting contractor** — Targets lighting-specific searches
4. **Generator installation service** — High-value service, lower competition
5. **Electric vehicle charging station contractor** — Growing search volume, future-proof

**Medium-Priority (Add After High-Priority):**
6. **Electrical repair service** — Covers maintenance/repair searches
7. **Security system installer** — Aligns with website services
8. **Electrical engineer** — May capture commercial/industrial inquiries
9. **Home automation company** — Smart home integration keyword

**Why These Categories Matter:**
- Each category = eligibility for additional keyword rankings
- GBP ranks for primary category + secondary categories when query matches
- Emergency categories trigger for "near me" + "24 hour" searches
- Specialty categories (generator, EV charger) = less competition, higher intent

### Category Optimization Process

1. **Access GBP Dashboard** → Click on business → "Info" → "Category"
2. **Add Secondary Categories** one at a time (don't rush; Google monitors bulk changes)
3. **Wait 7-10 days** between adding categories (avoid spam signals)
4. **Monitor Rankings** for new keyword appearances after each category addition
5. **Remove Underperforming Categories** after 60 days if no ranking/traffic improvement

---

## 8. BUSINESS HOURS OPTIMIZATION

### Current Hours Conflict

| Listing | Hours |
|---------|-------|
| **GBP #1 (Primary)** | Open 24 hours |
| **GBP #2 (Duplicate)** | Closes 5 PM |
| **Website** | "Open 24 hours, seven days a week" |

### 🔴 Critical Issue
Duplicate listings show conflicting hours → Customer confusion + Google trust penalty

### ✅ Recommended Action
1. **Confirm actual hours with client:** Is MCC Electric truly 24/7 for emergencies?
2. **If yes (24/7 emergency):**
   - Primary GBP: "Open 24 hours"
   - Website: Maintain "24/7 Emergency Service" messaging
3. **If no (office hours + emergency dispatch):**
   - Primary GBP Hours: "Mon-Fri 8am-5pm, Sat 9am-1pm"
   - Add "24/7 Emergency Service Available" in description
4. **Merge duplicate listing** to eliminate conflicting data

**Best Practice:** If offering 24/7 emergency service, set hours to "Open 24 hours" and clarify in description that office hours differ.

---

## CONCLUSION & PRIORITY ACTIONS

### Summary
MCC Electric has a **strong foundation** (4.9★ rating, 73 reviews) but **critical infrastructure issues** (duplicate listings, NAP inconsistencies) are limiting visibility. With proper optimization, this business can dominate local Map Pack rankings within 60-90 days.

### Top 3 Priorities (This Week)
1. **Merge duplicate Roselle GBP listings** — Recover fragmented review equity
2. **Fix NAP inconsistencies** — Standardize business name/phone across Manta, Yelp, BBB
3. **Seed Q&A section** — Post 3-4 strategic Q&As to control narrative + feed AI Overviews

### ROI Projection
- **Investment:** 15-20 hours operator time (photo collection, GBP updates, citation fixes)
- **Expected Return:** +50-75% increase in GBP-generated calls within 30 days
- **Average Client Value:** If $500/job average × 15-20 additional monthly jobs = **$7,500-10,000/month incremental revenue**

### Next Steps
1. **Operator:** Provide GBP access + photo assets within 48 hours
2. **Silas:** Begin Week 1 implementation (NAP cleanup, duplicate merge, Q&A seeding)
3. **Week 2 Check-In:** Review GBP Insights data, adjust strategy based on early signals
