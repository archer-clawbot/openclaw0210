**Location:** Albany, NY (441 New Karner Rd., Albany, NY 12205)  
**Business Type:** Full-Service Marketing Agency (NYS WBE Certified)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Brawn Media is a full-service marketing agency in Albany, NY, competing in a crowded local market against established players like Overit, Media Logic, Advance Media NY, and Elevation 10K. Their differentiators include:

- **NYS Women-Owned Business Certification** (WBE)
- **American Marketing Association MARCOM Awards** (Website Design & Video Production)
- **Full-service capability** (8 core service lines)
- **40+ pages of blog content** demonstrating thought leadership

### Current Content Status
- **Existing Blog:** 40 pages of content with strong focus on AI/SEO trends (2026-relevant topics)

2. **Local + regional SEO expansion** (Albany, Saratoga, Capital District, Troy, Schenectady)
