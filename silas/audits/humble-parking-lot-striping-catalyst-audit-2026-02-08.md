## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Humble Parking Lot Striping is a parking lot striping and sealcoating service provider based in Humble, TX serving Harris County and Montgomery County. The website is well-structured with strong on-page content, ranking #1 for primary brand queries. **The single biggest issue holding them back is the absence of a verified Google Business Profile and near-zero citation footprint**, which means they're invisible in the Local Pack/Maps despite having a competitive website. Secondary markets (Kingwood, Spring, Atascocita) show no organic or local presence.

| Week 2 | GBP verified and fully configured | GBP live + 8 services configured |
| Month 1 | First Local Pack appearances for brand queries | SoLV baseline established |

| Month 6 | Expansion into secondary markets (Kingwood, Atascocita) | SoLV 10%+ in 3 secondary cities |

---

## 12. INVESTMENT & ROI PROJECTION

| Service | Monthly Cost | Duration |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| Local SEO Foundation Package | $1,500-2,500/mo | 6 months minimum |
| Includes: GBP management, citation building, review gen, content, reporting | | |

**Projected ROI:**

Based on industry data:
- Average parking lot striping job: $500-2,500
- Current website traffic: Unknown (needs Analytics access)
- Current leads/month: Unknown

**Conservative Estimate:**
- With GBP + reviews + citations → 5-10 additional leads/month
- At 30% close rate → 1.5-3 new jobs/month
- At $1,000 avg job value → $1,500-3,000/month additional revenue
- ROI: 60-200% within 6 months

---

## 13. CONCLUSION

Humble Parking Lot Striping has a **solid website foundation** with strong service pages, unique city content, and good technical performance. However, **the complete absence of a Google Business Profile, reviews, and citations means the business is essentially invisible in local search**—the most critical channel for service-area businesses.

**#1 Priority:** Create and verify a Google Business Profile immediately. Without GBP, nothing else matters for local SEO.

**If they do nothing:** Competitors with established GBP listings and reviews will continue to capture 100% of Local Pack visibility. The website will only attract users who search the exact brand name.

**If they execute this plan:** Within 90 days, expect to appear in the Local Pack for primary keywords. Within 6 months, should dominate Humble market and expand into Kingwood/Atascocita.

*Prepared using the CATALYST SEO Methodology by LocalCatalyst.ai*

**Next Step:** Operator must provide GBP login credentials or create the listing. Once GBP is live, Archer dispatches Tier 1 tasks immediately.
