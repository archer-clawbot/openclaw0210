## 🔴 Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)

### 1. No Images Detected on Homepage
**Issue:** Zero `<img>` tags found on homepage. Images appear to be CSS backgrounds.  
**Impact:** Search engines can't index images; missing Google Images traffic; no alt text for accessibility.  
**Fix:** Convert hero/service images to proper `<img>` tags with descriptive alt text containing keywords.

### 2. No Review/Rating Schema
**Issue:** No `AggregateRating` or `Review` schema present.  
**Impact:** Missing star ratings in search results = lower CTR vs competitors with stars.  
**Fix:** Add review schema once reviews are collected. Consider review generation campaign.

### 3. No Social Profiles Linked
**Issue:** `sameAs` array in schema is empty.  
**Impact:** Missing social signals; no social proof; weaker entity association.  
**Fix:** Create/claim profiles on Google Business, Facebook, Yelp, BBB. Add URLs to schema.

### 4. FAQ Schema Missing
**Issue:** FAQ content exists on pages but no `FAQPage` schema markup.  
**Impact:** Missing FAQ rich snippets in search results.  
**Fix:** Add FAQ schema to service pages that contain Q&A content.

---

## 🟡 Moderate Issues (Prioritize This Month)

### 5. No External Outbound Links
**Issue:** Zero external links on homepage.  
**Impact:** Unnatural link profile; missed opportunity to cite authoritative sources (ADA.gov, Texas fire code).  
**Fix:** Add 2-3 relevant external links to authority sites (ADA resources, local government).

### 6. Thin Content Risk on POI Pages
**Issue:** 20+ "Near [Landmark]" location pages may have duplicate/thin content.  
**Impact:** Potential Google thin content penalty; wasted crawl budget.  
**Recommendation:** Audit POI pages. Either add 300+ words of unique content per page or consolidate/noindex weaker pages.

### 7. No Breadcrumb Schema
**Issue:** Breadcrumb navigation likely exists visually but no `BreadcrumbList` schema.  
**Impact:** Missing enhanced navigation display in SERPs.  
**Fix:** Add breadcrumb schema to all inner pages.

### 8. Blog Under-Optimized
**Issue:** Only 3 blog posts; not indexed in sitemap; no author schema.  
**Impact:** Missing long-tail keyword opportunities.  
**Fix:** Add blog URLs to sitemap. Implement `Article` schema. Plan monthly content calendar.

## Conclusion

Humble Parking Lot Striping has built a solid website foundation that's better than most local service businesses. The site architecture, technical implementation, and on-page optimization are strong.

**The biggest gaps are off-site:**
1. Google Business Profile (verify it's claimed)
2. Reviews (need social proof)
3. Citations (need NAP consistency across the web)
4. Backlinks (not assessed in this audit)

**On-site priorities:**
1. Fix the image SEO issue
2. Add structured data (FAQ, Breadcrumbs, Reviews)
3. Build out blog content for long-tail traffic

With these improvements, the site is well-positioned to dominate local search for parking lot striping services in the Humble/Northeast Houston market.
