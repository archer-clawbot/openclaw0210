## Conclusion

Humble Parking Lot Striping has built a **strong technical foundation** that outperforms most local competitors. The website is fast, well-structured, and ranks #1 for the primary keyword.

**However, the business is leaving significant money on the table due to:**

1. **Missing Google Business Profile** — Cannot compete in Local Pack
2. **Zero reviews** — Losing clicks to competitors with star ratings
3. **Minimal citations** — Only 2-3 directory listings found
4. **Weak backlinks** — No authority signals beyond the website itself
5. **Secondary market gaps** — Not ranking in Kingwood, The Woodlands, etc.

**The fix is straightforward:** This is a citation/review problem, not a website problem. With 90 days of focused off-page work, this site should dominate local search for parking lot striping across the entire Northeast Houston market.

**Estimated investment to fix:** $500-1,500/month for 3 months (citation building, review generation, GBP management)

**Estimated return:** If properly executed, expect 30-50% increase in leads within 6 months.
