Your reviews are often the first impression potential customers have of you — and they directly impact whether someone calls you or clicks on your competitor.</p>\n<p>But most businesses don't have a system for getting reviews. They don't respond to negative reviews. They don't monitor their reputation across platforms. And they lose customers because of it.</p>\n<p>LocalCatalyst's review management service helps you get more 5-star reviews, respond to every review (positive and negative), and turn your reputation into your best marketing asset.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What Is Review Management?</h2>\n<p>Review management is the practice of actively generating, monitoring, and responding to online reviews across Google, Yelp, Facebook, and other review platforms.</p>\n<p>It's not just about getting more reviews (though that's part of it). It's about:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Review Generation</strong><br />Asking happy customers to leave reviews at the right time, in the right way, on the right platform.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Review Monitoring</strong><br />Tracking every new review across all platforms so you never miss one.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Review Responses</strong><br />Responding professionally to every review — positive and negative — to show customers (and Google) that you're engaged.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Reputation Repair</strong><br />Addressing negative reviews, requesting removal of fake/spam reviews, and burying bad reviews with fresh positive ones.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Leveraging Reviews for Marketing</strong><br />Featuring your best reviews on your website, in ads, and in marketing materials.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why Your Business Needs Review Management</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Reviews Influence Buying Decisions</strong></p>\n<p>93% of consumers say online reviews impact their purchasing decisions. A business with 4.5+ stars gets significantly more clicks and calls than one with 3.8 stars.</p>\n<p><strong>2. More Reviews = Higher Rankings</strong></p>\n<p>Google factors review quantity, recency, and ratings into local Map Pack rankings. Businesses with 50+ recent reviews rank higher than businesses with 10 old reviews.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Review Responses Build Trust</strong></p>\n<p>Responding to reviews (especially negative ones) shows potential customers that you care. 89% of consumers read businesses' responses to reviews.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Negative Reviews Aren't the End</strong></p>\n<p>A well-handled negative review can actually build trust. Customers expect some negative reviews — they just want to see that you respond professionally and fix problems.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Reviews Are Free Marketing</strong></p>\n<p>Every 5-star review is a testimonial you didn't have to ask for. Feature them on your website, in ads, and in proposals. They're social proof that sells.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What's Included</h2>\n<h3>Review Generation System</h3>\n<p>We set up automated review request campaigns that get you more reviews without being pushy or spammy.</p>\n<p><strong>Includes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>SMS/email review request templates</li>\n<li>Timing optimization (when to ask for reviews)</li>\n<li>Multi-platform strategy (Google, Yelp, Facebook, industry-specific sites)</li>\n<li>QR codes and review links for in-person requests</li>\n<li>Follow-up sequences for non-responders</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Review Monitoring</h3>\n<p>We monitor your reviews across all major platforms and alert you immediately when a new review comes in.</p>\n<p><strong>Platforms monitored:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google</li>\n<li>Yelp</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Industry-specific sites (Avvo for lawyers, Healthgrades for doctors, Angi for home services, etc.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Professional Review Responses</h3>\n<p>We respond to every review on your behalf — positive and negative — within 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Positive review responses include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Thank the reviewer by name</li>\n<li>Reference the specific service or experience they mentioned</li>\n<li>Mention your team or values</li>\n<li>Invite them back</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Negative review responses include:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Empathize with their experience</li>\n<li>Take responsibility (no defensiveness or excuses)</li>\n<li>Offer offline resolution (phone call, email, refund)</li>\n<li>Keep it professional and brief</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Reputation Repair</h3>\n<p>If you have old negative reviews dragging down your rating, we help you fix it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flag fake or spam reviews for removal</li>\n<li>Request removal of reviews that violate platform policies</li>\n<li>Generate fresh positive reviews to bury old negative ones</li>\n<li>Develop a response strategy for legitimate complaints</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Monthly Reporting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Total reviews (new this month)</li>\n<li>Average rating (overall and by platform)</li>\n<li>Review sentiment analysis</li>\n<li>Competitor comparison (your rating vs. top 3 competitors)</li>\n<li>Most common themes (positive and negative)</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>How We Manage Your Reviews</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Audit Your Current Reputation</h3>\n<p>We analyze your current reviews across all platforms, identify problem areas, and benchmark your rating against competitors.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Set Up Review Generation</h3>\n<p>We build and launch automated review request campaigns via SMS/email.

On average, businesses see a 3-5x increase in review volume within the first 60 days. If you serve 50 customers/month and we have a 20% response rate, that's 10 new reviews/month.</p>\n<p><strong>Q2: Can you remove negative reviews?</strong><br />A: We can flag reviews that violate platform policies (spam, fake reviews, offensive language, competitor sabotage). Google and Yelp will remove those. Legitimate negative reviews stay — but we respond professionally and generate fresh positive reviews to offset them.</p>\n<p><strong>Q3: Do you write the review responses or do I?</strong><br />A: We write them. You can approve them before they go live, or you can give us full autonomy (most clients do after the first month once they trust our tone).</p>\n<p><strong>Q4: What if I don't have many customers yet?</strong><br />A: That's okay. Even 1-2 reviews per month compounds over time. We'll work with your current volume and scale as you grow.</p>\n<p><strong>Q5: Will asking for reviews hurt my relationship with customers?</strong><br />A: Not if done right. We use polite, well-timed requests that feel natural. Most customers are happy to leave a review if asked — they just forget unless prompted.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6: What if I get a really bad review?</strong><br />A: We respond professionally within 24 hours, empathize, offer to resolve offline, and then work on generating fresh positive reviews to bury it. One bad review won't sink you — how you respond matters more.</p>\n<p><strong>Q7: Do you handle Yelp reviews?</strong><br />A: Yes. Yelp is tricky (they filter reviews aggressively), but we monitor it and respond to all reviews that stick.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ready to Build Your Reputation?</h2>\n<p>Let's get you more 5-star reviews and turn your reputation into your best marketing asset.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/contact/\" class=\"button\">Get Started</a></p>\n<p>Or get a free reputation audit first → <a href=\"/contact/\">Free Audit</a></p>",
