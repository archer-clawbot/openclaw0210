If Google finds conflicting information — a different phone number on Yelp, a misspelled street name on Facebook — it loses trust in your location data. And that tanks your local rankings.</p>\n<p>Local citations are mentions of your business across online directories: Google Business Profile, Yelp, Facebook, Yellow Pages, industry-specific directories, and dozens more.</p>\n<p>LocalCatalyst builds, cleans up, and manages your local citations so Google trusts your business location — and ranks you higher in the Map Pack.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What Are Local Citations?</h2>\n<p>A local citation is any online mention of your business name, address, and phone number (NAP). Citations can be structured or unstructured:</p>\n<p><strong>Structured Citations</strong><br />Listings on business directories like Google Business Profile, Yelp, Yellow Pages, Bing Places, and industry-specific directories.</p>\n<p><strong>Unstructured Citations</strong><br />Mentions of your business in blog posts, news articles, local event pages, or sponsorship listings.</p>\n<p><strong>Why Citations Matter for Local SEO:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Google uses citations to verify your location.</strong> If your NAP is consistent across 50+ directories, Google trusts that you're a real, legitimate business at that address.</li>\n<li><strong>Citations are a ranking factor for the Map Pack.</strong> Businesses with more accurate, consistent citations rank higher in local search results.</li>\n<li><strong>Citations drive direct traffic.</strong> People find your business on Yelp, Yellow Pages, and other directories — not just Google.</li>\n<li><strong>Inconsistent citations hurt your rankings.</strong> If Google finds 10 different phone numbers for your business across directories, it doesn't know which one is correct — so it ranks you lower.</li>\n</ol>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why Your Business Needs Accurate Citations</h2>\n<p><strong>1. NAP Consistency Is a Top Local Ranking Factor</strong></p>\n<p>Google's local search algorithm heavily weights citation consistency. Businesses with accurate, consistent NAP data across 50+ directories rank higher than businesses with inconsistent or missing data.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Duplicate Listings Confuse Google</strong></p>\n<p>If you have three different Google Business Profiles (maybe from an old location, a misspelled name, or a previous owner), Google doesn't know which one is real. Duplicate listings dilute your rankings.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Customers Call the Wrong Number</strong></p>\n<p>If your phone number is wrong on Yelp, you lose customers. If your address is wrong, customers show up at the wrong place. Accurate citations = better customer experience.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Citations Are Long-Term Assets</strong></p>\n<p>Unlike ads, citations don't expire. Once your business is listed on 50+ directories, those listings stay live and drive traffic indefinitely.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Competitors with Better Citations Outrank You</strong></p>\n<p>If your competitor has clean, consistent citations and you don't, they rank higher — even if their business is newer or has fewer reviews.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What's Included</h2>\n<h3>Citation Audit</h3>\n<p>We scan 75+ directories and identify:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Existing listings (accurate or inaccurate)</li>\n<li>Duplicate listings</li>\n<li>Missing listings</li>\n<li>Inconsistent NAP data (different phone numbers, misspellings, old addresses)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Citation Building</h3>\n<p>We manually submit your business to 50+ high-authority directories, including:</p>\n<p><strong>Major Directories:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Google Business Profile</li>\n<li>Bing Places</li>\n<li>Apple Maps</li>\n<li>Facebook</li>\n<li>Yelp</li>\n<li>Yellow Pages</li>\n<li>MapQuest</li>\n<li>Foursquare</li>\n<li>BBB (Better Business Bureau)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Industry-Specific Directories:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Home services: Angi, HomeAdvisor, Thumbtack, Porch</li>\n<li>Medical: Healthgrades, Vitals, Zocdoc, WebMD</li>\n<li>Legal: Avvo, Justia, FindLaw, Lawyers.com</li>\n<li>Restaurants: OpenTable, TripAdvisor, Zomato</li>\n<li>Automotive: YellowBot, Manta, RepairPal</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Local Directories:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Chamber of Commerce</li>\n<li>Local business associations</li>\n<li>City/county directories</li>\n<li>Neighborhood directories</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Citation Cleanup</h3>\n<p>If you have inconsistent or duplicate listings, we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Claim and correct inaccurate listings</li>\n<li>Merge or remove duplicate listings</li>\n<li>Update old phone numbers, addresses, or business names</li>\n<li>Standardize formatting (e.g., \"Street\" vs. \"St.\")</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ongoing Citation Management</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Monitor citations for changes (directories sometimes overwrite your data)</li>\n<li>Update citations if your phone number or address changes</li>\n<li>Add new citations as relevant directories emerge</li>\n<li>Quarterly citation health report</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>How We Build and Clean Up Your Citations</h2>\n<h3>Step 1: Citation Audit (Week 1)</h3>\n<p>We scan 75+ directories to identify existing listings, duplicates, and inconsistencies.

Some directories take time to approve listings (up to 30 days), but we submit everything within the first 2 weeks.</p>\n<p><strong>Q2: How many citations do I need?</strong><br />A: We recommend at least 50 for most businesses. Competitive markets (lawyers, dentists, restaurants in big cities) benefit from 75-100+.</p>\n<p><strong>Q3: What if I move or change my phone number?</strong><br />A: We update all your citations as part of our ongoing management service. If you're not on the monthly plan, we can update citations for a one-time fee.</p>\n<p><strong>Q4: Can you remove old listings from a previous location?</strong><br />A: Yes. We claim the old listing and either update it to your new location or remove it entirely (depending on platform policies).</p>\n<p><strong>Q5: Do citations help my Google Business Profile rank?</strong><br />A: Absolutely. Consistent citations are one of the top ranking factors for the local Map Pack. They signal to Google that your business is legitimate and located where you say it is.</p>\n<p><strong>Q6: What if my business name has changed?</strong><br />A: We update all citations to reflect your new business name. It's important to do this quickly — inconsistent business names hurt rankings.</p>\n<p><strong>Q7: Do citations help with organic SEO (not just local)?</strong><br />A: Yes. Many directories pass link equity (backlinks), which helps your overall domain authority and organic rankings.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Ready to Clean Up Your Citations?</h2>\n<p>Let's build accurate, consistent local citations that boost your rankings.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/contact/\" class=\"button\">Get Started</a></p>\n<p>Or get a free citation audit first → <a href=\"/contact/\">Free Audit</a></p>",
