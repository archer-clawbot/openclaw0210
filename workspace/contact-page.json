We'll still give you the audit and recommendations. You can implement them yourself or come back when you're ready.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you work with businesses outside the US?</strong><br />A: Currently, we focus on US-based businesses because local SEO strategies vary significantly by region. We may expand internationally in the future.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How much do your services cost?</strong><br />A: Our services start at $800/month for ongoing GBP management. Most clients invest $1,500-3,000/month depending on market competitiveness and scope. We'll give you exact pricing on the strategy call.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: How long until I see results?</strong><br />A: Quick wins (like GBP optimization) can show movement in 2-4 weeks. Full local SEO campaigns typically show significant results within 8-12 weeks. We'll give you a realistic timeline based on your market.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: Do you guarantee #1 rankings?</strong><br />A: No. Anyone who guarantees #1 rankings is lying. We do guarantee transparent methodology, consistent execution, and measurable progress. Rankings follow when you do SEO right.</p>\n<p><strong>Q: What if I've been burned by an SEO agency before?</strong><br />A: We hear that a lot. Most agencies overpromise and underdeliver. We do the opposite — we set realistic expectations and then exceed them. Our transparent reporting means you'll always know what we're doing and why.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Other Ways to Reach Us</h2>\n<p><strong>Email:</strong><br /><a href=\"mailto:hello@localcatalyst.com\">hello@localcatalyst.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Phone:</strong><br /><a href=\"tel:+1-XXX-XXX-XXXX\">[PHONE TBD]</a><br /><em>Available Monday-Friday, 9am-6pm CT</em></p>\n<p><strong>Prefer Email?</strong><br />Fill out the form below and we'll respond within 24 hours.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Contact Form</h2>\n<p>[wpforms id=\"1\"]</p>\n<p><em>We respect your privacy.
