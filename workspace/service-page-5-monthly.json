New businesses enter your market. If you're not actively managing your local presence, you fall behind.</p>\n<p>Monthly local SEO management keeps you ranking, keeps your Google Business Profile active, and keeps fresh content flowing so you stay ahead of competitors.</p>\n<p>LocalCatalyst's monthly management service includes GBP posts, content updates, ranking tracking, review responses, and ongoing optimization — everything you need to maintain and improve your local search rankings.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What Is Monthly Local SEO Management?</h2>\n<p>Monthly local SEO management is an ongoing service that keeps your local search presence optimized, active, and competitive.</p>\n<p>Think of it like maintaining a car. You don't just buy a car and never change the oil. Local SEO is the same — you need regular maintenance to keep performing.</p>\n<p><strong>What monthly management includes:</strong></p>\n<p><strong>1. Google Business Profile Management</strong><br />Weekly posts, photo uploads, Q&amp;A management, review responses, and insight reporting.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Content Updates</strong><br />Fresh blog posts, service page updates, location page refinements, and seasonal content.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Ranking Tracking &amp; Reporting</strong><br />Weekly keyword tracking, monthly performance reports, competitor analysis.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Technical SEO Monitoring</strong><br />Site speed checks, mobile optimization, broken link fixes, schema updates.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Strategic Adjustments</strong><br />Based on performance data, we adjust strategy — prioritize different keywords, add new location pages, shift content focus, etc.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>Why Your Business Needs Ongoing Local SEO</h2>\n<p><strong>1. Google Rewards Active Profiles</strong></p>\n<p>Businesses that post weekly to their Google Business Profile, upload fresh photos, and respond to reviews rank higher than stale profiles.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Competitors Are Optimizing</strong></p>\n<p>If you optimize once and stop, your competitors will pass you. Local SEO is competitive — you need to stay active to stay ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Algorithm Changes Affect Rankings</strong></p>\n<p>Google updates its local search algorithm multiple times per year. Monthly management means we adapt quickly to changes so your rankings stay stable.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Content Ages</strong></p>\n<p>A blog post that ranks today may not rank in 6 months. We refresh underperforming content, add new content, and keep your site relevant.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Reviews Compound</strong></p>\n<p>The more reviews you generate each month, the stronger your reputation gets. Monthly management includes ongoing review generation and responses.</p>\n<hr />\n<h2>What's Included</h2>\n<h3>Google Business Profile Management</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>4 GBP posts per month</strong> (Updates, Offers, Events)</li>\n<li><strong>Weekly photo uploads</strong> (team, work, location)</li>\n<li><strong>Q&amp;A management</strong> (answer customer questions, seed helpful FAQs)</li>\n<li><strong>Review monitoring &amp; responses</strong> (respond to all reviews within 24 hours)</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly GBP insights report</strong> (views, clicks, calls, direction requests)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Content Creation &amp; Updates</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>1-2 blog posts per month</strong> (800-1,500 words, locally-focused, keyword-optimized)</li>\n<li><strong>Service page updates</strong> (refresh underperforming pages, add new sections)</li>\n<li><strong>Location page updates</strong> (add new service areas, update existing pages)</li>\n<li><strong>Seasonal content</strong> (holiday hours, seasonal services, local events)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Ranking Tracking &amp; Reporting</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Weekly keyword tracking</strong> (track 10-20 target keywords)</li>\n<li><strong>Monthly performance report</strong> (rankings, traffic, conversions)</li>\n<li><strong>Competitor analysis</strong> (your rankings vs. top 3 competitors)</li>\n<li><strong>Insights &amp; recommendations</strong> (what's working, what needs adjustment)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Technical SEO Monitoring</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Site speed checks</strong> (monthly performance audit)</li>\n<li><strong>Mobile optimization</strong> (ensure mobile-friendly design)</li>\n<li><strong>Broken link fixes</strong> (identify and fix 404 errors)</li>\n<li><strong>Schema updates</strong> (add or refine schema markup as needed)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Strategic Adjustments</h3>\n<p>Based on monthly performance data, we:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adjust keyword targeting</li>\n<li>Add new location or service pages</li>\n<li>Shift content focus</li>\n<li>Experiment with new GBP post formats</li>\n<li>Optimize underperforming pages</li>\n</ul>\n<hr />\n<h2>How Monthly Management Works</h2>\n<h3>Week 1: GBP Posts &amp; Photos</h3>\n<p>We create and publish 1 GBP post, upload fresh photos, and respond to any new reviews.</p>\n<h3>Week 2: Content Creation</h3>\n<p>We write and publish 1 blog post or update an existing service/location page.</p>\n<h3>Week 3: GBP Posts &amp; Q&amp;A</h3>\n<p>We publish another GBP post and manage Q&amp;A (answer new questions, seed helpful ones).</p>\n<h3>Week 4: Reporting &amp; Planning</h3>\n<p>We compile your monthly report (rankings, traffic, GBP insights) and plan next month's strategy based on performance data.</p>\n<p>This cycle repeats every month.
