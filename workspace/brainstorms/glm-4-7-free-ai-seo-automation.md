## 📋 THE GLM 4.7 SEO WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Content Creation (One-Click)
**The Prompt:**
```
You are my SEO content assistant. Create:
- A compelling headline
- 1,500-word blog post
- 5 subheadings
- Meta description (155 characters)
- Include keyword: [YOUR KEYWORD]
- Make it conversational and easy to read
```

**What you get:**
- Complete article with proper structure
- SEO-optimized meta description
- Proper heading hierarchy
- Ready to edit and publish

**Time:** ~2 minutes (vs 2 hours manually)

---

### Step 2: Keyword Research Automation
**The Prompt:**
```
I run a business in [YOUR NICHE]. Give me 20 longtail keyword ideas that beginners would search for. Focus on questions and "how to" phrases. Format as a simple list.
```

**Example output for SEO niche:**
- How to do keyword research for free
- Best SEO tools for beginners
- How to rank on Google without backlinks
- What is local SEO and how does it work
- [etc.]

**What Julian does with these:**
1. Pick low-competition keywords (KD 10 and below)
2. Write articles targeting those keywords
3. Embed original YouTube videos in articles
4. Add links to funnels throughout
5. Include lead magnets at the top

**Result:** Traffic compounds over time, funnel captures leads

---

### Step 3: Content Optimization (Quality Control)
**The Prompt:**
```
Review this content and optimize it for SEO:
[PASTE YOUR BLOG CONTENT]

Check for:
- Keyword density
- Readability
- Missing subheadings
- Opportunities to add relevant keywords naturally
- Meta description improvement
- Semantic SEO (related keywords)

Then rewrite with improvements.
```

**What GLM 4.7 does:**
- Analyzes current content
- Identifies optimization opportunities
- Rewrites with better semantics
- Improves formatting and structure
- **It's a thinking model** — shows its work

**Julian's observation:**
> "The formatting looks a lot nicer, the content itself seems a lot nicer. This is another way to attack your SEO strategy."

---

### Step 4: Multi-Platform Repurposing
**The Strategy:**
1. Write content for your website with GLM 4.7
2. Create a **variation** of the same content
3. Post the variation on Reddit
4. Get traffic from both sources

**Julian's Reddit results:**
- **70,000 views/month** on Reddit alone
- More views than his actual website on some topics
- Free to post, no ad spend
- Compounds with website traffic

**Why this works:**
> "You're not just optimizing for Google. You're creating content that works across multiple platforms. Reddit + your site = 2× the traffic for the same effort."

## 🧠 PROMPT ENGINEERING FOR BETTER OUTPUT

### The Problem with AI Content
**What people say:**

**Julian's response:**
> "AI sounds robotic when you give it robotic prompts. This is like blaming the steak for tasting bad when you cooked it wrong."

### The Solution: Great Prompts
**What to include in every prompt:**
1. **Tone** - Conversational, professional, casual, authoritative
2. **Examples** - Show it content you like
3. **Reading level** - 8th grade, college, expert
4. **Specific audience** - Who's reading this?
5. **Desired outcome** - What should the reader do after reading?

**Formula:**
> Garbage in, garbage out.  
> Great prompts = great content.
