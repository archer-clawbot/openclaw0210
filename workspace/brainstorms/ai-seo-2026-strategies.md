**Source:** Julian Goldie comprehensive AI SEO training  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Context:** Complete AI SEO system using GLM 4.7, Claude, and Customer Magnet Framework to go from 3 → 176 clicks/day

---

## 🎯 THE RESULTS: 3 → 176 CLICKS/DAY

**Julian's agency website (JulianGoldie.com):**
- **Before:** 3 clicks/day (essentially zero)
- **After:** 176 clicks/day
- **Growth:** Exponential trajectory
- **Strategy:** AI-powered content creation + multi-platform publishing
- **Free traffic:** 5,280 visits/month from Google alone
- **Annual:** 63,360+ free visitors per year (just from Google, not counting AI search, Reddit, etc.)

**The approach:**
> "We consistently publish content around low competition keywords throughout the page. Typically we'll take all of our videos and then turn them into video transcripts."

---

## 🤖 STRATEGY #1: GLM 4.7 (Free Chinese AI)

### What It Is
**GLM 4.7:**
- Chinese AI agent (but interface is in English)
- **Completely free** to use
- Competes with ChatGPT on benchmarks
- Actually beats ChatGPT on coding tasks

**Why use it:**
> "When you actually see GLM 4.7's benchmark scores, it actually beats ChatGPT on coding tasks. And when I've tested it out myself, here's what I found: for SEO content, for automations, for basic coding, this just works just as well as ChatGPT."

**Julian's analogy:**
> "That's like finding the best Muay Thai gym in Bangkok is free. You'd be crazy not to train there."

---

### What You Can Do With GLM 4.7

**1. Create SEO Content (1-Click)**
**The prompt:**
```
You are my SEO content assistant.

Create:
- A compelling headline
- 1,500-word blog post
- 5 subheadings
- Meta description
- Target keyword: [YOUR KEYWORD]

Make it conversational and helpful.
```

**Result:** Full SEO-optimized article in seconds

---

**2. Keyword Research Automation**
**The prompt:**
```
I run a business in the [YOUR NICHE] industry.

Give me 20 long-tail keyword ideas that beginners would search for.

Focus on questions and "how to" phrases.

Format as a simple list.
```

**Example output (SEO niche):**
- How to do keyword research for free
- What is local SEO
- How to rank on Google in 2026
- Best SEO tools for beginners
- How to optimize meta descriptions
- (etc.)

---

**3. Content Optimization/Review**
**The prompt:**
```
Review this content and optimize it for SEO.

[PASTE YOUR CONTENT]

Check for:
- Keyword density
- Readability
- Missing subheadings
- Opportunities to add relevant keywords naturally
- Meta description improvement
- Semantic SEO (related keywords)
```

**What it does:**
- Analyzes existing content
- Identifies keyword density issues
- Checks structure
- Suggests semantic improvements
- Rewrites with better optimization

**Julian's note:**
> "The formatting looks a lot nicer as well and actually the content itself seems a lot nicer."

---

**4. Internal Links, FAQ, Schema**
**Use cases:**
- Generate FAQ sections
- Create internal linking suggestions
- Build schema markup
- Optimize existing pages

---

**5. Build SEO Tools (Micro SaaS)**
**Examples:**
- SEO dashboard (track rankings, store data, share with clients)
- Task list manager (optimize keywords, add content, track progress)
- Lead magnet calculators
- ROI calculators

**How to do it:**
- Give GLM 4.7 a prompt to build a tool
- It generates code
- Host locally or deploy
- Use for clients or internally

---

## 📝 STRATEGY #2: CLAUDE FOR SEO CONTENT

### Why Claude?

**Julian's take:**
> "Claude is one of the most powerful and sentient ways to write content in 2026. I really call Claude the depth engine because ChatGPT is really good for quick tasks, Gemini is great for research, but Claude goes deep."

**What makes Claude different:**
- Understands context like no other AI
- Remembers what you told it 50 messages ago
- Creates content that actually sounds human
- Best for long-form SEO content

---

### The Exact Claude Prompt for SEO

**The prompt:**
```
You are my SEO content assistant.

Create an SEO-optimized article.

KEYWORD: [YOUR TARGET KEYWORD]

SOURCE CONTEXT ABOUT ME:
[Your business info, what you do, who you serve, pages you want to funnel traffic to]

CONTENT GENERATION GUIDELINES:
- Easy to read
- Conversational
- UK/US grammar
- FAQs at the end
- Headers (H2, H3)
- Keyword in first line
- First person perspective
- Include internal links to my pages:
  - [Page 1 URL]
  - [Page 2 URL]
  - [Page 3 URL]

Write a 1,500-word article that ranks and converts.
```

**What you get:**
- SEO-optimized structure
- Natural keyword placement
- Internal links inserted
- FAQs for featured snippets
- Conversational tone
- Ready to publish

---

### Claude Projects (Game-Changer)

**What they are:**
- Pre-configured workspaces
- Store your writing instructions
- Remember your brand voice
- Instant context

**Julian's examples:**
- **Writing tweets** project (formats for Twitter)
- **Writing live stream notes** project (formats for blog)
- **Offer builder** project (generates new offers for AI Profit Boardroom)

**How to set up:**
1. Go to Projects in Claude
2. Create new project (e.g., "SEO Content")
3. Add your SEO prompt as project instructions
4. Add source context (your business info)
5. Every time you start a chat in that project → instant context

**Result:**
> "You can easily create a new project, plug in the prompt we talked about earlier, and then it can create content in your style that actually ranks every time. You just plug in the content."

---

### The Content That Ranks (Julian's Blog Example)

**Structure of a ranking blog post:**
1. **Lead magnet at top** (captures emails immediately)
2. **YouTube video embed** (same topic as article)
3. **Introduction** (keyword in first line)
4. **Body content** (H2s, H3s, structured)
5. **Internal links throughout** (funnel to money pages)
6. **FAQs at end** (featured snippet opportunity)

**Where links point to:**
- Free community (AI Success Lab) → nurtures leads
- Paid community (AI Profit Boardroom) → direct conversion
- SEO services page → book a call
- Backlink portal → order services

**Julian's multi-ranking strategy:**
> "If I type in like 'notebook SEO' on Google, what you're going to see here is that my website ranks, but also a lot of my videos rank as well. So you can see here 1, 2, 3, 4 different videos ranking on the first page of Google for that particular keyword... We got 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 times on the first page of Google plus our shorts. So 10 times on the first page of Google there."

---

## 💰 STRATEGY #3: CUSTOMER MAGNET FRAMEWORK

### The Big Idea

**The problem most people have:**
> "Most people only create traffic content. They get traffic, but they don't get any customers."

**The solution:** Balance three types of content

---

### The 3 Types of SEO Content

#### 1. Traffic Content
**Purpose:** Get eyeballs

**Examples:**
- "What is [topic]"
- Listicles ("10 best...")
- How-to guides (general)
- Definition posts

**Characteristics:**
- High volume keywords
- Informational intent
- Attracts browsers, not buyers
- Top of funnel

**Julian's take:**
> "Most people only create option one, which is traffic content. They get traffic, but they don't get any customers."

---

#### 2. Trust Content
**Purpose:** Build authority

**Examples:**
- Case studies
- Behind-the-scenes
- Strategy breakdowns
- Industry insights
- "How I did X" posts

**Characteristics:**
- Shows expertise
- Builds credibility
- Positions you as authority
- Middle of funnel

---

#### 3. Transaction Content
**Purpose:** Convert browsers into buyers

**Examples:**
- "[Product A] vs [Product B]"
- "Best [tool] for [specific use case]"
- "[Service] reviews"
- "Should you use [solution]?"

**Characteristics:**
- High buyer intent
- Comparison terms
- Decision-making queries
- Bottom of funnel

**Julian's note:**
> "Transaction content captures people who are ready to take action. This is the content that converts in days, not months."

---

### Transaction Content Prompt (Claude)

**The prompt:**
```
Create a comparison article: [AI Profit Boardroom vs Learning Alone]

TARGET AUDIENCE: [Your ideal customer]

STRUCTURE:
- Hook (why this matters)
- What most people try (and why it fails)
- The community/product approach
- Direct comparison table
- Real member results
- Who this is for (and who it's not for)

TONE:
- Genuinely helpful, not salesy
- Reader should feel informed, not sold to
- Use stories and examples
- Include real testimonials

Make it 1,500 words.
```

**What this creates:**
- Bottom-of-funnel content
- High conversion rate
- Captures people at decision moment
- Ranks AND converts

---

### Why This Framework Works

**The shift:**
> "Like I used to celebrate every traffic spike like 'Ooo we hit 10,000 visitors per month.' But my business wasn't growing because those visitors weren't buyers. They were reading like 'what is SEO' content which is interesting but they weren't ready to take action. When I shifted to the customer magnet content method, traffic actually dropped but leads went up because I was attracting the right people."

**Key insight:**
> "Traffic is a vanity metric. Customers are the real score."

---

### Low Volume Buyer Keywords > High Volume Browser Keywords

**Example comparison:**

**Browser keyword:**
- "What is email marketing"
- Volume: 50,000 searches/month
- Buyer intent: LOW
- Conversion rate: 0.1%

**Buyer keyword:**
- "Best email marketing tool for coaches"
- Volume: 500 searches/month
- Buyer intent: HIGH
- Conversion rate: 5-10%

**Question:**
> "Would you rather have 10,000 people who kind of sort of might be interested or 100 people who are ready to buy? I know which one I'd choose."

**Julian's strategy:** Target buyer keywords, not volume keywords

---

## 🔄 THE COMPLETE AI SEO WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Keyword Research
**Tool:** GLM 4.7 (free)

**Prompt:**
```
I run a business in [YOUR NICHE].

Give me 20 long-tail keyword ideas that beginners would search for.

Focus on questions and "how to" phrases.
```

**Then validate with Ahrefs:**
- Look for KD 10 or less
- Check for buyer intent
- Prioritize "best," "vs," "review" keywords

---

### Step 2: Content Creation
**Tool:** Claude (Projects feature)

**Prompt:**
```
[Use the SEO prompt from earlier]

Keyword: [YOUR KEYWORD]
Source context: [YOUR BUSINESS INFO]
```

**Output:** 1,500-word SEO-optimized article

---

### Step 3: Optimization Review
**Tool:** GLM 4.7 (free)

**Prompt:**
```
Review this content and optimize it for SEO.

[PASTE CONTENT]

Check for keyword density, readability, structure, semantic SEO.
```

**What it does:** Identifies improvements, rewrites with better optimization

---

### Step 4: Multi-Platform Publishing

**Platforms to publish:**
1. **Your website** (main blog)
2. **Reddit** (r/YourSubreddit)
3. **LinkedIn** (article or post)
4. **YouTube** (embed video in blog)
5. **Twitter/X** (thread or link)

**Why multi-platform:**
> "We don't just get traffic to our website. We also get traffic to our videos from Google, and we also get traffic to our Reddit and LinkedIn."

**Result:** 4-10x placements on page 1 for ONE keyword

---

### Step 5: Internal Linking & Conversion

**Every piece of content should:**
- Link to your **free lead magnet** (e.g., AI Success Lab)
- Link to your **paid product** (e.g., AI Profit Boardroom)
- Link to your **services page** (e.g., Book a Call, Backlink Portal)

**Julian's approach:**
> "When we rank this content on Google, they'll actually click through to our free community. They join this community, they sign up, they become a lead, and then they get nurtured into becoming a client later."

---

## 📊 RANKING PROOF & EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Notebook LM SEO

**Search on Google:** "notebook LM SEO"

**Julian's rankings:**
- YouTube video #1
- YouTube video #2
- YouTube video #3
- YouTube video #4
- Website article
- LinkedIn article
- Reddit post
- YouTube Shorts (4x)

**Total:** 10+ placements on page 1

---

---

---

## 🧠 LIMITING BELIEFS → NEW BELIEFS

### 1. Writing Quality
- ❌ Old: "I need to be a good writer to create content"
- ✅ New: "I just need to be a good editor. AI is my writing team."

**Example:**
> "Richard Branson is dyslexic. He can't write. But he's built a billion-dollar empire. He surrounds himself with people and tools that do what he can't. Claude actually writes better than most humans."

---

### 2. AI Content Quality
- ❌ Old: "AI will make my content sound robotic"
- ✅ New: "AI sounds robotic when you give it robotic prompts"

**Julian's analogy:**
> "This is like blaming the steak for tasting bad when you cooked it wrong. Garbage in, garbage out. Great prompts = great content out."

---

### 3. SEO Timeline
- ❌ Old: "SEO takes too long. I don't have patience for 6-12 months."
- ✅ New: "Low-competition keywords can rank in 24 hours"

**Why:**
> "You're borrowing Reddit's authority. Google already trusts Reddit. So when you post there, Google trusts you instantly."

---

### 4. AI Content Rankings
- ❌ Old: "AI content doesn't rank on Google"
- ✅ New: "AI-assisted content ranks. Pure AI garbage doesn't."

**The difference:**
- **Bad:** "Hey ChatGPT, write me a blog post about dog training"
- **Good:** "Use this prompt with brand context, your expertise, your examples, and your editing"

**Julian's take:**
> "Google doesn't penalize AI content. They just penalize bad content. Bad content is generic, unhelpful, thin, and copied from everywhere else."

---

### 5. Human vs AI Writing
- ❌ Old: "I need to write everything myself to maintain quality"
- ✅ New: "The best content is AI-drafted and human-refined"

**Analogy:**
> "Muhammad Ali didn't become the greatest by training alone. He had trainers, coaches, sparring partners. They helped him become better than he could have done alone. Claude is your content training partner."

---

### 6. Traffic vs Customers
- ❌ Old: "SEO is just about getting traffic"
- ✅ New: "The right SEO strategy gets customers, not just visitors"

**Julian's experience:**
> "I used to celebrate every traffic spike. But my business wasn't growing because those visitors weren't buyers. When I shifted to the customer magnet content method, traffic actually dropped but leads went up."

---

### 7. Keyword Volume
- ❌ Old: "I need to rank for high-volume keywords"
- ✅ New: "Low-volume buyer keywords beat high-volume browser keywords"

**Example:**
- "What is email marketing" (50,000/month, low intent)
- "Best email marketing tool for coaches" (500/month, high intent)

**Question:** Which would you rather rank for?
