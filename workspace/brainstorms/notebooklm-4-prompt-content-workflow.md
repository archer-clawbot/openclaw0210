## 📋 THE 4-PROMPT WORKFLOW

**How it works:**

- By the end: content ready to publish

**Example used:** AI Profit Boardroom (but swap in your own business/keywords)

**The workflow stays the same for any niche.**

---

## 🔍 PROMPT 1: RESEARCH PHASE

### The Exact Prompt
```
Research the keyword "how to use AI automation to grow online communities."

Gather top 20 ranking pages and build a ranked table of:

- Primary and secondary keywords
- Search intent classification
- Gaps we can exploit
- Source link summary
```

### What This Does
**Purpose:** Builds your foundation

**Why you need it:**

- Pulls out patterns
- Shows you what works

- Creates your roadmap

**Key insight:**
> "You're not just getting a list of keywords. You're getting an analysis of what's working in your space."

**For the example (AI Profit Boardroom):**
- Keyword targets people who want to grow communities using AI
- That's exactly who we want to reach
- Helps understand the landscape
- Shows opportunities
- Faster than any manual research

**Translation:**
> "You're gathering intelligence before you create anything. You're seeing what your competitors are doing and you're finding the gaps they're not filling."

---
