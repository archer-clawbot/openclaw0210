# Claude: The Depth Engine for SEO Content That Ranks
**Source:** Julian Goldie live stream on Claude for SEO  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Context:** How to use Claude's superior context understanding and human-like writing to create SEO content that actually ranks in 2026

---

## 🎯 THE RESULTS: SAME GROWTH, DIFFERENT ENGINE

**Julian Goldie's agency site:**
- **Started:** 2 clicks/day
- **Now:** 176 clicks/day
- **Method:** Claude-powered content creation
- **Trajectory:** Consistent upward growth

**Why Claude?**
> "I really call Claude the depth engine. ChatGPT is really good for quick tasks. Gemini is great for research. But Claude goes deep. It understands context like no other AI. It remembers what you told it 50 messages ago. It creates content that actually sounds human."

---

## 🧠 WHY CLAUDE IS DIFFERENT

### The Three AI Tiers
**ChatGPT:**
- Best for: Quick tasks, rapid iteration
- Weakness: Context drops off, generic output

**Gemini:**
- Best for: Research, data gathering
- Weakness: Less human-sounding

**Claude:**
- Best for: **Deep context**, human-like writing, **remembering conversations**
- Strength: Understands nuance, maintains voice, **sounds like a real person**

**The Claude advantage:**
> "Most people use Claude like a fancy search engine. Ask a question, get an answer, move on. That's like buying a Ferrari and only driving it to the grocery store. You're missing 90% of its power."

---

## 📋 THE CLAUDE SEO WORKFLOW

### Step 1: The SEO-Optimized Article Prompt
**Core Prompt Structure:**
```
Create an SEO-optimized article for this keyword: [KEYWORD]

Source context about me/my business:
- Who we are: [BUSINESS NAME & DESCRIPTION]
- What we do: [SERVICES/PRODUCTS]
- Where to funnel traffic: [LINKS TO YOUR PAGES]
- Target audience: [WHO'S READING THIS]

Writing style:
- Easy to read, conversational
- UK/US grammar (specify)
- First person perspective
- Include FAQs at the end
- Use proper headers (H2, H3)
- 1,500-2,000 words
```

**Example keyword:** "SEO training Japan"

**What Claude generates:**
- Complete article with proper structure
- Conversational, human-sounding content
- Natural keyword placement
- FAQ section at end
- Internal links to your funnels
- Meta description

**Time:** 5-7 minutes (vs 2-4 hours manually)

---

### Step 2: The Multi-Platform Domination Strategy
**Julian's blog structure:**
1. **Title** - Includes target keyword
2. **Introduction** - Hook the reader
3. **Embedded video** - Semantically related to topic
4. **Body content** - Breakdown of topic with subheadings
5. **Links to funnels** - Throughout the page (convert traffic)
6. **FAQs** - At the end (answer related queries)

**Key insight:**
> "We take all of our videos and turn them into video transcripts. If I type 'notebook SEO' into Google, my website ranks, but also a lot of my videos rank as well."

**Results for "notebook SEO":**
- **4 videos ranking** on page 1 of Google
- **1 article ranking** on page 1
- **Multiple shorts ranking**
- **Total:** Dominating 6-10 spots on page 1

---

### Step 3: AI Search Engine Optimization
**The new reality:**
> "Everyone's worried that SEO doesn't work anymore or it's harder to get traffic from Google. I think honestly, if you have the right strategies, you can rank MORE times inside the top 10 rankings."

**Example: "How to do NotebookLM SEO"**

**Perplexity results:**
- LinkedIn article ranking
- Julian's website (juliangoldie.co.uk) ranking
- YouTube video in top 10
- Reddit article ranking
- **Julian shows up #1** for the keyword
- **4 different pieces of content** in top 10

**Google results:**
- **6 times on page 1** (articles + videos + shorts)
- **4 shorts ranking**
- **Total:** 10 times on page 1 of Google

**The shift:**
> "It's almost getting easier to do SEO if you know the right strategies."

## 💡 THE FERRARI ANALOGY: TRAINING CLAUDE ON YOUR BUSINESS

### Most People Use Claude Wrong
**What they do:**
1. Ask a question
2. Get an answer
3. Move on
4. Repeat (with no context carried over)

**Result:** Generic, surface-level output

---

### The Right Way: Give Claude Context
**What to include:**
1. **About your business** - What you do, who you serve, what makes you different
2. **Your voice and style** - How you write, what tone you use, examples of your best content
3. **Your audience** - Who's reading, what problems they have, what they want
4. **Your goals** - What should the reader do after reading?

**How to do this:**
- Use Claude Projects (permanent context)
- Or paste context into every new chat
- Or reference previous chats ("Remember the barbershop we talked about?")

**Result:**
> "The real magic happens when you give Claude context about your business, train it on your voice and style, and use it as a thinking partner, not just a tool."

---

## 📊 THE LONG-TERM MINDSET

### Content Won't Rank Every Time
**Julian's honest take:**
> "Your content is not going to rank every time. Just to be clear here. The more content you create, the more opportunities you have to rank."

**The reality:**
- **Some content ranks immediately** (days/weeks)
- **Some content doesn't rank** (wrong keyword, too competitive)
- **Some content ranks later** (6 months, 12 months)

**That's okay.**

---

### Playing the Long Game
**Julian's strategy:**
> "We create content every single day. We know some of it's going to rank. We know some of it's not going to rank. We know some of it's going to rank in six months, maybe 12 months. And that's okay. We're playing the long game. We want to rank for decades, not for weeks or days."

**The math:**
- **Before:** 3 clicks/day
- **Now:** 176 clicks/day
- **Monthly:** 5,280 visitors (176 × 30)
- **Annually:** 63,360 visitors (5,280 × 12)

**Plus:**
- AI search traffic (Perplexity, ChatGPT)
- Multi-platform repurposing (Reddit 70k views/month)
- YouTube traffic from embedded videos

---

### The Compounding Effect
**What compounds:**
1. **Authority** - More content = more topical coverage = Google trusts you more
2. **Internal links** - More pages = more linking opportunities
3. **Long-tail rankings** - More content = more chances to rank for unexpected keywords
4. **Brand recognition** - More visibility = more branded searches

**Timeline:**
- **Month 1-3:** Slow, few rankings
- **Month 4-6:** Some traction, a few articles ranking
- **Month 7-12:** Compound growth, multiple rankings
- **Year 2+:** Authority site, ranking for hundreds of keywords

---

## 🚫 MYTHS VS REALITY: AI CONTENT IN 2026

### Myth #1: "AI content doesn't rank on Google"
**Reality:**
> "Google doesn't penalize AI content. They just penalize bad content."

**What's bad content?**
- Generic (could be about anyone)
- Unhelpful (doesn't answer the query)
- Thin (not comprehensive)
- Copied (just rehashed from elsewhere)

**What's good content?**
- Specific to your audience
- Genuinely helpful
- Comprehensive
- Has unique perspective

**The truth:**
> "AI-assisted content ranks. Pure AI garbage, of course it doesn't rank. There's a big difference."

---

### The Spectrum of AI Content
**Pure AI garbage:**
```
"Hey ChatGPT, write me a blog post about dog training."
```
- No context, no voice, no specificity
- Generic output
- **Won't rank**

**AI-assisted quality content:**
```
"Hey Claude, using my brand context, my expertise, my examples, and my editing, create a blog post about dog training for first-time puppy owners who struggle with leash pulling."
```
- Specific audience, clear problem, brand context
- Unique perspective
- **Will rank**

**The difference:**
> "Google's much more likely to rank that. Claude helps you create good content faster. That's it. Good content faster."

---

### Myth #2: "I need to write everything myself to maintain quality"
**Reality:**
> "The best content is AI-drafted and human-refined."

**The Muhammad Ali analogy:**
> "Muhammad Ali didn't become the greatest by training alone. He had trainers, coaches, sparring partners, and they helped him become better than he could have done alone. Claude is your content training partner."

**The roles:**
- **Claude drafts** → You refine
- **Claude suggests** → You decide
- **Claude does heavy lifting** → You add expertise

**Result:**
> "Better content in less time. That's not cheating, that's just smart training."
