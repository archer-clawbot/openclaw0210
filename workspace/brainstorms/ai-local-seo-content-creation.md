# AI-Powered Local SEO Content Creation
**Source:** Julian Goldie live stream with Dino (plumber, Harvey Bay, Australia)  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Context:** Using Perplexity AI + Claude for local SEO content creation

---

## 🎯 CORE STRATEGY: AI-Powered Local Content at Scale

**Dino's situation:**
- Plumbing business in Harvey Bay, Australia
- Website live for only a couple weeks
- Using OnPage AI for content optimization
- Needed help structuring pages vs blogs

**Julian's approach:**
- Use Perplexity AI for keyword research
- Use Claude 3.5 for section-by-section content writing
- Reverse engineer competitors for structure
- Optimize with entities and LSIs

---

## 🔍 PERPLEXITY AI KEYWORD RESEARCH

### Local Keyword Discovery Prompt

```
Niche = plumbers Harvey Bay

Find me some low competition keywords using the alphabet soup method to generate customers for my local business.
```

**What this does:**
- Perplexity generates keyword ideas using autocomplete method
- Focuses on local + service combinations
- Looks for low-hanging fruit

**Example results:**
- Best emergency plumber Harvey Bay
- Emergency plumber Harvey Bay
- Plumbers Harvey Bay prices
- Hot water plumber Harvey Bay
- Drain cleaning Harvey Bay

**Why "emergency" keywords are gold:**
- High buyer intent
- Ready to spend money NOW
- Premium pricing opportunity

---

## ✅ VALIDATING AI KEYWORD SUGGESTIONS

**Problem:** AI sometimes generates BS keywords that no one searches for

**Solution:** Validate with real data

### Method 1: Google Autocomplete
- Type keyword into Google search
- If it shows in autocomplete = people search for it
- If not = probably BS

### Method 2: Ahrefs Free Keyword Tool
- Go to Ahrefs free keyword generator
- Paste the keyword
- Set country (Australia, USA, etc.)
- Check volume

**Example:**
- "Best plumbers Harvey Bay" → Volume 100+, KD low = good keyword
- If volume shows 0 or doesn't appear = skip it

**Rule:** If it's in Google autocomplete AND shows in Ahrefs = valid keyword

---

## 📄 BLOG POST VS SERVICE PAGE (Critical Decision)

**Dino's confusion:**
> "I didn't know if 'best plumbers Harvey Bay' should be a page or a blog."

**Julian's answer:** Look at what Google is showing

### The Test:
1. Type keyword into Google
2. Look at first page results
3. What's ranking?

**If you see:**
- **Directories (Yelp, Yellow Pages, Top 10 lists)** → Create a blog or directory-style page
- **Service pages / homepages** → Create a service page
- **Blog posts** → Create a blog post

**Example: "Best plumbers Harvey Bay"**
- Results show: directories, service pages, homepages
- **Decision:** Create a service page (NOT a blog)

**Key principle:** Match the search intent Google is already showing

---

## 🏗️ PAGE STRUCTURE: SERVICE PAGES VS BLOG POSTS

### Service Pages (Money Pages)
**When to use:**
- "Plumbers Harvey Bay" (main keyword)
- "Emergency plumber Harvey Bay"
- "Drain cleaning Harvey Bay"
- "Hot water systems Harvey Bay"

**Structure:**
- H1 = exact match keyword
- H2s = services, benefits, pricing, FAQs, CTAs
- CTA buttons throughout
- Phone number prominently displayed
- Reviews/testimonials
- Service areas

### Blog Posts (Supporting Content)
**When to use:**
- "How to fix a leaky faucet"
- "Signs you need a new hot water system"
- "DIY plumbing tips"
- "How much does plumbing cost in Australia"

**Structure:**
- H1 = keyword
- H2s = steps, tips, guides
- Internal links to service pages
- CTA at end pointing to service page

**Key insight:**
> "Plumbers Harvey Bay" = service page  
> "Plumbers Urangan" (suburb) = service page  
> "Best plumbers Harvey Bay" = service page (even though it says "best")

---

## 🛠️ ONPAGE AI TOOL (Dino's Secret Weapon)

**What it does:**
- Write in your target keyword
- It writes the entire article in minutes
- Auto-optimizes with Google entities
- AI detection included
- Has a little rocket ship emoji (sold!)

**Where to find it:** OnPage AI (search on Google)

**How Dino uses it:**
1. Find target keyword (e.g., "emergency plumber Harvey Bay")
2. Plug into OnPage AI
3. Get list of required Google entities (right side of tool)
4. Export entities to spreadsheet
5. Give entities to Claude with prompt: *"Write a page about plumbers Harvey Bay. Make sure ALL these words are included."*
6. Paste Claude's output back into OnPage AI
7. Verify all entities are included
8. Publish to website

**Why this workflow works:**
- OnPage AI finds the entities Google wants to see
- Claude writes naturally with those entities
- OnPage AI verifies optimization
- Human edits for uniqueness

## 📝 CONTENT OUTLINE AUTOMATION

### Tools for Automating Outlines

**Option 1: Phrase.io (What Julian uses)**
- Lifetime deal on AppSumo
- Pulls headings from competitors
- Shows word count benchmarks
- Content grading score

**Option 2: Right Seed (AppSumo alternative)**
- Only $44 one-time payment
- Content optimization score
- Reverse engineers top-ranking pages
- Similar to Surfer/Phrase

**Option 3: Jasper AI**
- Workflows for content creation
- More expensive

**Option 4: Sista (Free option)**
- Content optimizer
- LSI and entity suggestions
- Not great for outlines but good for optimization

### How to Use Phrase (or similar tools):

1. **Input target keyword** (e.g., "best plumbers Harvey Bay")
2. **Select country** (Australia)
3. **Tool analyzes top 10 competitors**
4. **Shows:**
   - Average word count (e.g., 1,200 words)
   - Common H2s and H3s
   - Entities and LSIs to include
   - Content grading (5,300 words, 1,800 words, etc.)

5. **Select relevant headings** from competitors
6. **Add to your outline**
7. **Hierarchy:** H1 → H2 → H3 (don't skip levels)

**Key insight from Julian:**
> "If the average word count on page 1 is 1,200 words, write 1,200 words BUT with less fluff and more value than competitors."

**Translation:** Don't just write longer content. Write BETTER content in FEWER words.

---

## 🤖 SECTION-BY-SECTION CONTENT WRITING (Julian's Method)

**Problem with "one-click" AI content:**
- Generic
- Low quality
- Doesn't match brand voice
- No unique insights

**Solution:** Write section by section with custom prompts

### Julian's Perplexity AI Workflow

**Step 1: Set up Perplexity Pro**
- Use Pro version (access to Claude 3.5 Sonnet)
- Settings → AI Models → Switch to Claude 3.5 Sonnet

**Step 2: Use section-specific prompt**

```
Heading = [Insert H2 here]

Write content for this heading. 

Content generation guidelines:
- Easy to read
- Feels conversational
- UK grammar (or US/AU grammar)
- Add subheadings and headings
- Keyword in the first line
- First person perspective
- Maximum 200 words (or 100 words for shorter sections)

Write from this perspective:
A local plumbing company called [Your Company Name]. Sell my services subtly throughout content.
```

**Example for "Blocked Drains Harvey Bay":**

```
Heading = Blocked drains Harvey Bay

Write content for this heading.

Content generation guidelines:
- Easy to read
- Feels conversational
- Australian grammar
- Add subheadings and headings
- Keyword in the first line
- First person perspective
- Maximum 200 words

Write from this perspective:
A local plumbing company called Dino's Plumbers. Sell my services subtly throughout content.
```

**What Perplexity outputs:**
- ~200 words
- Nicely formatted
- Sells services subtly
- Conversational tone
- CTA at the end

**Example output:**
> "Dealing with blocked drains? We've seen it all at Dino's Plumbers. Here's what causes blockages... Here's why you shouldn't ignore them... Here's why you should use a professional instead of DIY."

**To shorten further:**
```
Cut this down to 100 words. Also semantically optimize it with LSIs and entities for the keyword [blocked drains Harvey Bay].
```

**Result:** Shorter, optimized, straight to the point.

---

## 🔬 ENTITY + LSI OPTIMIZATION

**What are entities?**
- People, places, things, concepts Google expects to see
- E.g., for "plumber Harvey Bay" → entities might be: "licensed," "emergency," "drain cleaning," "hot water," "gas fitting"

**What are LSIs (Latent Semantic Indexing keywords)?**
- Related terms Google expects in context
- E.g., for "plumber" → LSIs: "pipes," "leak," "fixtures," "repairs," "installation"

### How to Get Entities for Your Content

**Option 1: OnPage AI**
- Shows entities on the right side of the tool
- Click to add them to content

**Option 2: Sista (Free)**
- Go to Content Optimizer
- Input keyword + location
- Get list of LSIs to include

**Option 3: Phrase.io**
- Automatically suggests entities from top-ranking pages

**Option 4: Ask Perplexity/Claude**
```
Find me LSIs and entities for the keyword "emergency plumber Harvey Bay"
```

### How to Inject Entities into AI Content

**Dino's workflow (best method):**

1. Use OnPage AI to get all required entities
2. Export to spreadsheet
3. Go to Claude
4. Prompt: *"I need to write a page about [topic]. Can you make sure ALL these words are included: [paste entity list]"*
5. Claude writes content with entities naturally integrated
6. Paste back into OnPage AI to verify
7. Publish

**Why this works:**
- You're not just stuffing keywords
- Claude integrates them naturally
- OnPage AI verifies optimization
- Google sees semantically complete content

## 📊 WORD COUNT BENCHMARKING

**How to figure out how long your content should be:**

1. Search your target keyword in Google
2. Look at top 10 results
3. Check word counts:
   - Result 1: 5,300 words
   - Result 2: 1,800 words
   - Result 3: 1,100 words
   - Result 4: 1,100 words

4. **Calculate average** (in this case ~1,200 words)
5. **Target that word count** but write with LESS fluff

**Julian's rule:**
> "If you can give more value than competitors in a LOWER word count, you'll win."

**Why?**
- People want quick answers
- Less fluff = better user experience
- Google rewards engagement, not length

**Application for LocalCatalyst:**
- Target keyword: "local SEO services Chicago"
- Check top 10 word counts
- Average: 1,500 words
- Write 1,500 words but make it more useful

## 🗺️ GOOGLE BUSINESS PROFILE (GMB) OPTIMIZATION

**Why GMB = 80/20 for local SEO:**
- Shows above organic results
- High conversion rate (people ready to call)
- Reviews = social proof

### Ronald Osborne's GMB Tips (SEO Elite Circle)

**Posted in the community:**

1. **Reviews are 80% of ranking**
   - More reviews = higher ranking
   - Example: 576 reviews ranks above 118 reviews

2. **Add lots of images and videos**
   - Google prioritizes visual content
   - Behind-the-scenes, service photos, team photos

3. **CTR with driving directions matters**
   - People clicking "Get Directions" = engagement signal
   - Optimize for this by making your listing appealing

4. **Align GMB with services on website**
   - If your GMB lists "emergency plumbing," your website MUST have an emergency plumbing page
   - Consistency = higher relevance

**Ronald Osborne context:**
- Also in Australia
- Makes $150k/month with partnerships
- These are his best GMB tips

---

## 🤔 AI DETECTION: SHOULD YOU CARE?

**Common concern:** "Will Google penalize me for AI content?"

**Julian's take:**
> "Google is already ranking AI content #1. They clearly don't care if it's AI. They care if it's AI SPAM."

**Example: Perplexity AI's website**
- They generate tons of AI content
- Went from 0 → 3.4 million traffic in 2 years
- All AI-generated
- Ranks incredibly well

**Julian's rule:**
> "I don't run AI content through AI detectors because Google doesn't care. But if you're running a billion-dollar company, be more conservative."

**When to humanize AI content:**
- High-risk industries (medical, legal, financial)
- Large companies with more to lose
- If your risk tolerance is low

**When NOT to worry:**
- Small local businesses
- Low-risk industries
- If you're editing and adding value anyway

**Key insight:**
> "Humanized content that passes AI detectors usually just reads worse. It's unnatural."

**Translation:** Focus on quality, not on passing AI detectors.

---

## 📚 INSERTING FACTS + STATISTICS

**Question from chat:** "Do you recommend injecting facts from reliable sources?"

**Julian's answer:**

### Best Way: Manual Insertion
- Find stats yourself
- Verify source
- Insert with citation

### AI-Automated Way: Perplexity Academic Mode

**How to use it:**

1. Go to Perplexity
2. Click "Focus" dropdown
3. Select "Academic" (or just default for most topics)
4. Prompt: *"Find me some statistics + references + case studies about [topic] in [location]"*

**Example:**
```
Find me some statistics + references + case studies about plumbing in Australia
```

**What you get:**
- List of facts
- Citations on the right side
- Links to sources

**How to use:**
- Copy facts into your content
- Add source citations
- Link to original sources

**Why this works:**
- Shows expertise (E-E-A-T)
- Builds trust
- Google loves cited sources

---

## 💰 CHEAP SEO TOOLS VIA APPSUMO

**Problem:** Tools like Surfer, Phrase, Jasper are expensive ($50-$200/month)

**Solution:** AppSumo lifetime deals

### How to Find Cheap Alternatives

1. Go to AppSumo.com
2. Search for tool category:
   - "Content optimization"
   - "SEO tools"
   - "Keyword research"
   - "Phrase" (to find alternatives)

3. Look for lifetime deals ($40-$200 one-time)

**Examples:**

- **Right Seed:** $44 (Surfer/Phrase alternative)
- **Phrase.io:** Lifetime deal (Julian uses this)
- **OnPage AI:** One-time payment

**Why this matters:**
- Tools pay for themselves after 1-2 months
- No recurring costs
- Same features as expensive tools

---

## 🏗️ STRUCTURING A LOCAL SEO WEBSITE

**Dino's confusion:**
> "I was creating pages for 'plumbers Harvey Bay' and 'plumbers Urangan' (suburb). Was that right?"

**Julian's answer:** Yes, that's correct.

### Local Service Page Structure

**Main service page:**
- URL: `/plumbers-harvey-bay`
- H1: Plumbers Harvey Bay
- Content: Overview of services, areas served, CTAs

**Suburb pages:**
- URL: `/plumbers-urangan`
- URL: `/plumbers-torquay`
- URL: `/plumbers-pialba`
- H1: Plumbers [Suburb Name]
- Content: Same as main but localized

**Service-specific pages:**
- URL: `/emergency-plumber-harvey-bay`
- URL: `/drain-cleaning-harvey-bay`
- URL: `/hot-water-systems-harvey-bay`

**Blog posts (supporting content):**
- URL: `/blog/how-to-fix-leaky-faucet`
- URL: `/blog/signs-you-need-new-hot-water-system`

**Internal linking structure:**
```
Homepage
  ├─ Plumbers Harvey Bay (main service page)
  │   ├─ Emergency Plumber Harvey Bay
  │   ├─ Drain Cleaning Harvey Bay
  │   └─ Hot Water Systems Harvey Bay
  ├─ Plumbers Urangan (suburb page)
  ├─ Plumbers Torquay (suburb page)
  └─ Blog
      ├─ How to Fix Leaky Faucet (links to service pages)
      └─ Signs You Need New Hot Water System (links to service pages)
```

---

## 🧠 HIERARCHY: H1 → H2 → H3

**Common mistake:** Skipping heading levels

**Wrong:**
```
H1: Plumbers Harvey Bay
H3: Emergency Services
H3: Drain Cleaning
```

**Right:**
```
H1: Plumbers Harvey Bay
H2: Emergency Services
  H3: 24/7 Availability
  H3: Fast Response Time
H2: Drain Cleaning
  H3: Residential
  H3: Commercial
```

**Why this matters:**
- Google understands content structure via headings
- Accessibility (screen readers rely on heading hierarchy)
- Better UX

**Rule:** Never skip from H1 to H3. Always go H1 → H2 → H3 → H4.

---

## 🎯 REVERSE ENGINEERING COMPETITORS

**How to steal (legally) from competitors:**

1. **Search target keyword in Google**
2. **Open top 5-10 results**
3. **Extract:**
   - Headings (H2s, H3s)
   - Word count
   - Topics covered
   - FAQs
   - Content structure

4. **Don't copy/paste headings exactly**
   - Reword them
   - Add your own angle

5. **Add something new**
   - New insight
   - Better formatting
   - More recent data
   - Unique perspective

**Julian's rule:**
> "Use AI to do 80-90% of the content. Then add something unique that competitors haven't done."

**Example:**
- Competitors have generic "Why Choose Us" section
- You add: "Here's what our last 50 customers said" (real testimonials)
