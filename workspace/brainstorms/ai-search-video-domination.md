**Source:** Julian Goldie video on ranking in AI search engines  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Context:** How to rank YouTube videos in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AIO overviews

---

## 🎯 THE BIG SHIFT: AI Search Engines Are the New Google

**The Game Has Changed:**
- People are now using ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude, and Google AIO overviews INSTEAD of traditional Google search
- These AI search engines actively pull from YouTube videos as sources
- **Almost zero competition** — most people haven't caught on yet
- Videos can rank in BOTH Google AND AI search results simultaneously

**Example:**
- "Notebook LM update" search
- Julian's video shows up:
  - 3x on first page of Google
  - Inside Google AIO overview
  - Inside Perplexity search results
  - Video created 4 HOURS ago (not 90 days)

**This is where YouTube was 10 years ago** — wide open and waiting for someone to claim the space.

## 🚀 WHY VIDEO DOMINATES AI SEARCH

### 3 Reasons AI Systems Love Video

**1. Multiple Signals**
- Audio
- Visual
- Transcripts
- Engagement metrics
- More data points for AI to understand content

**2. Builds Trust Faster**
- AI recognizes video creators put in more effort
- Signals authority
- Higher perceived quality

**3. Gets Cited More**
- When AI needs to recommend a source, video feels more complete than a blog post
- AI can generate blog posts instantly (doesn't need to reference them)
- AI CANNOT create long-form videos with case studies
- Therefore, AI references videos more often

**Key insight:**
> "A video with 500 views that perfectly answers a specific question will beat a video with 500,000 views that's too broad."

## 📊 AI SEARCH vs TRADITIONAL SEO

| Factor | Traditional Google SEO | AI Search (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Claude) |
|--------|----------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Time to rank** | 90+ days minimum | Days (sometimes hours) |
| **Competition** | Millions of websites | Almost zero competition |
| **Ranking factors** | Keywords + backlinks | Context, relevance, authority |
| **What matters** | Vanity metrics (subscribers, views) | Content quality + relevance |
| **Cost** | Expensive backlinks required | Free if done right |
| **Algorithm risk** | Changes can tank your site overnight | Focuses on relevance, not gaming |
| **Entry barrier** | High (need SEO expertise) | Low (anyone can start) |
| **Video vs text** | Video is one option | Video is PREFERRED |

## 🎥 HOW AI SEARCH ENGINES USE YOUTUBE

### Perplexity Example

**Search:** "Notebook AI updates"

**What Perplexity does:**
1. Actively searches YouTube for relevant videos
2. Reviews sources (3 different YouTube videos pulled in)
3. Cites them in the answer
4. Links directly to videos

**Who's ranking:**
- Julian Goldie SEO (multiple videos)
- Ranking in BOTH Google AND Perplexity
- Same video = double exposure

### Claude Example
- Also references video content in its responses
- Looks for authoritative video sources
- Prefers comprehensive explanations

### Google AIO (AI Overviews)
- "Notebook LM update" search
- Pulls in AIO view
- Links to Google sources AND YouTube videos
- Julian's video cited multiple times

**Translation:** One video = visibility across multiple AI platforms

---

## 🤖 AI AVATAR VIDEOS (No Camera, No Production Costs)

### Old Belief:
> "I need expensive equipment, lighting, and camera skills to make good videos."

### New Reality:
> "AI avatar videos create professional videos for free."

## ⚡ SPEED: 4 HOURS TO RANK (Not 90 Days)

**Traditional SEO timeline:**
- Create content
- Wait 90+ days
- Hope Google notices
- Hope algorithm doesn't change

**AI Search timeline:**
- Create video
- Upload to YouTube
- Rank in 4 hours (or days)

**Real example:**
- Julian's video on "how to do X"
- Published: 4 hours ago
- Ranking: #1 on Google for target keyword
- Also ranking: Inside Perplexity

**Why so fast:**
- Perplexity updates in real time
- ChatGPT pulls from recent sources
- AI search doesn't rely on traditional ranking factors (backlinks, domain age, etc.)
- Quality + relevance = instant visibility

**Julian's note:**
> "Traditional SEO: we tell clients to expect 90 days minimum. AI search is a different game. Your video could get cited within days of publishing."

## 🎯 WHAT AI SEARCH CARES ABOUT

### Doesn't Matter:
- ❌ Subscriber count
- ❌ Total views
- ❌ Domain authority
- ❌ Expensive backlinks
- ❌ Age of channel/website
- ❌ Vanity metrics

### Does Matter:
- ✅ Content quality
- ✅ Relevance to the query
- ✅ Specificity (answers a specific question)
- ✅ Video format (multiple signals)
- ✅ Transcripts (AI reads them)
- ✅ Context and depth

**Example:**
- Julian has 300,000+ subscribers on YouTube
- Some newer videos with FEWER views get cited by AI more than viral videos
- Why? Newer videos are more relevant and specific
- Viral videos are often too broad

**Translation:** You can compete from day one. No need to build a massive channel first.

## 📋 30-DAY FRAMEWORK TO RANK IN AI SEARCH

### Week 1: Keyword Research

**Goal:** Find questions people are asking in your niche

**Method 1: Google Autocomplete**
- Type your niche keyword into Google
- Look at auto-suggest results
- These are real questions people are asking

**Example:**
- Type: "Notebook LM"
- Auto-suggests: "Notebook LM update," "Notebook LM tutorial," "Notebook LM vs X"
- Each = potential video topic

**Method 2: ChatGPT Prompt**

```
Act as a market researcher. 

My niche is [SEO / plumbing / real estate / etc.].

Find me 20 specific questions people are asking in this niche that I can create videos to answer.

Make them specific and long-tail.
```

**What you get:**
- List of 20+ video topics
- Super specific questions
- Almost too long-tail (but perfect for starting)

**Action:**
- Pick 10 questions
- These become your first 10 videos

---

### Week 2: Create Videos

**Tool:** Notebook LM (free)

**Process:**
1. Open Notebook LM
2. Input your topic/question
3. Add sources (articles, research, your own insights)
4. Generate video (AI narrates + designs)
5. Review (6+ minutes long, professional)
6. Download
7. Upload to YouTube

**Alternative:** HeyGen or other AI avatar tools

**What you need:**
- Script (can be AI-generated with ChatGPT)

**Output:** 5-10 videos created this week
