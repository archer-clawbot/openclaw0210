# LocalCatalyst Lead Generation Plan — 90 Days to 30 Clients

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Goal:** Acquire 30 paying clients in 90 days  
**Budget:** $5,000-10,000  
**Owner:** Cody (LocalCatalyst)  

---

## Executive Summary

**Target:** 30 clients @ $2,000/month avg = $60k MRR in 90 days

**Strategy:** Fully automated/paid channels — no personal networking, warm outreach, or cold calling required

**Why this works:**
- You don't have to reach out to anyone personally
- All channels run 24/7 without your involvement
- Once set up, requires only 1-2 hours/day to monitor and respond
- Fully scalable (can increase budget to get more clients faster)

**Channels (in priority order):**
1. **Google Ads** (intent-driven, fastest) — 10 clients
2. **Cold email** (scalable, low cost) — 10 clients
3. **LinkedIn outreach** (high-intent B2B) — 6 clients
4. **Facebook/Meta Ads** (awareness + retargeting) — 3 clients
5. **Directory listings** (passive leads) — 1 client
6. **YouTube Ads** (video-first targeting) — 0 clients in 90 days (testing only)
7. **YouTube Organic** (long-term brand) — 0 clients in 90 days (but start now for 6-12 month payoff)

**Expected close rates:**
- Google Ads: 10% (100 leads → 10 clients)
- Cold email: 2% (500 emails → 10 clients)
- LinkedIn: 5% (120 DMs → 6 clients)
- Facebook Ads: 10% (30 leads → 3 clients)
- Directories: 10% (10 leads → 1 client)

**Budget allocation:**
- Google Ads: $7,500 (60% of budget)
- Facebook/Meta Ads: $2,500 (20% of budget)
- Tools (Apollo, Instantly, LinkedIn Sales Nav): $500/month = $1,500
- Directories: $500 (one-time)
- YouTube equipment: $300 (one-time)
- **Total: $12,300**

```
Subject: [Company] showing up on Google?

Hi [FirstName],

Quick question: when someone searches "[Service] in [City]," does [Company] show up in the top 3?

Most [Industry] businesses lose 60-70% of potential customers because they're buried on page 2-3 of Google.

We specialize in getting [Industry] businesses to the top of local search (Google Maps + organic).

Recent client ([Similar Business]) went from "not ranking" → top 3 for 47 keywords in 90 days. Traffic went from 500 → 12,000/month.

Interested in seeing what we'd do for [Company]?

- Cody
LocalCatalyst
P.S. — Reply "audit" and I'll send you a free SEO audit (no strings attached).
```

**Email 2: Case Study (if no reply to Email 1)**
```
Subject: How [Client Name] got 300% more customers

[FirstName],

Following up from last week. Not sure if you saw my email about local SEO for [Company].

Quick case study:

[Client Name] (also in [Industry]) was stuck with 20-30 website visitors/month. Barely anyone found them on Google.

We rebuilt their SEO strategy: fixed technical issues, rewrote content, optimized their Google Business Profile, built local citations.

90 days later:
- 12,000 website visitors/month (up 600%)
- Ranking #1-3 for 47 keywords
- 80+ phone calls/month from Google
- 300% increase in new customers

Would something similar help [Company]?

Happy to show you exactly what we'd do (free 30-min call, no pitch).

- Cody
```

**Email 3: Last Chance (if no reply)**
```
Subject: Last email (promise)

[FirstName],

Last email from me — I know you're busy.

If local SEO isn't a priority right now, totally understand. But if you're losing customers to competitors who rank higher on Google, let's talk.

I'm offering 5 free SEO audits this month (normally $500). Takes 30 minutes, I'll show you:
- Why [Company] isn't ranking
- What your competitors are doing
- Exact 90-day plan to fix it

Reply "audit" if you want one of the 5 spots. Otherwise, I'll leave you alone. :)

- Cody
LocalCatalyst

```

**Once connected, send DM (2-3 days later):**
```
Hey [Name],

Thanks for connecting! Quick question:

How are you currently getting new customers? Mostly referrals, or do people find you on Google?

I ask because we just helped [Client Name] (also in [Industry]) go from 500 → 12,000 website visitors/month by ranking them #1-3 on Google Maps + local search.

Would love to show you what we're doing (no pitch, just 15 min to see if it'd work for [Company]).

Free this week?

- Cody
```

**Follow-up if no response (5 days later):**
```
[Name],

## Sales Process (Once You Have Leads)

### Step 1: Discovery Call (30 min)
**Goal:** Understand their problem, qualify them

**Questions:**
1. "Tell me about your business. How do you currently get customers?"
2. "What's working? What's not?"
3. "Have you tried SEO before? What happened?"
4. "If I could show you how to get 2-3x more customers from Google, would that be worth $2k/month?"
5. "What's your timeline? Are you ready to start in the next 30 days?"

**Qualify:**
- ✅ Business is profitable (>$500k/year revenue)
- ✅ Budget exists ($1k-3k/month)
- ✅ Decision-maker on the call (owner, marketing director)
- ✅ Motivated (losing customers, competitors ranking higher)

**If qualified:** Schedule follow-up call to present audit

### Step 4: Onboard + Deliver
**Week 1:**
