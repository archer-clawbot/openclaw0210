**Source:** Julian Goldie comprehensive course/demo on Google Antigravity  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Context:** How to use Google's Antigravity IDE with Gemini 3 to build apps, tools, and SEO assets autonomously with AI agents

---

## 🎯 THE BIG ANNOUNCEMENT: GOOGLE ANTIGRAVITY

**What it is:**
- Google's brand new **AI-powered IDE** (Integrated Development Environment)
- Launched: **November 18th, 2025** (public preview)
- **Agent-first development** platform
- Powered by **Gemini 3 Pro** (Google's most advanced AI model)

**What makes it different:**
> "This doesn't just write code. It builds entire projects autonomously. It's like having a full development team working for you around the clock."

**Key differentiator:**
- **Most AI coding tools:** Help you write code faster (suggestions, autocomplete)
- **Antigravity:** Actually builds entire projects for you (planning, coding, testing, deployment)

**The shift:**
> "These agents don't just help you. They actually do the work for you. Like actually does it from start to finish."

---

## 🚀 KEY FEATURES

### 1. Gemini 3 Integration
**What it powers:**
- Better reasoning
- Understands context deeply
- Generates smarter outputs
- Truly multimodal (trained on images, text, video, audio)

**Why it matters:**
> "The same model running AI mode in Google search. The same one in the Gemini app. The same technology behind how Google is ranking and displaying content today."

**Translation:** You're building with the same AI that powers Google search

---

### 2. AI Agent System (Autonomous Agents)
**What they do:**
- Plan tasks autonomously
- Write code
- Test code
- Fix bugs
- Take screenshots
- Browser automation
- Verify everything works
- All without constant human oversight

**Three access points:**
1. **Code editor** (writes and edits files)
2. **Terminal** (runs commands, installs dependencies)
3. **Integrated browser** (tests apps, clicks buttons, takes screenshots)

**The workflow:**
> "You tell it what you want in plain English. Then multiple AI agents work together to build this stuff out for you. One agent writes the code. Another agent tests it. Another agent fixes bugs. They even take screenshots and videos to show you what they did."

---

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflows
**How it works:**
- Spawn multiple agents
- Each agent has a specific task
- They work in parallel
- Don't interfere with each other

**Example scenario:**
- Agent 1: Writes the UI code
- Agent 2: Writes backend logic
- Agent 3: Runs tests
- Agent 4: Creates documentation
- Agent 5: Handles deployment

**Julian's take:**
> "It's like having a whole team of developers working for you. Except it's AI agents and they don't sleep. They don't take breaks. They just build."

---

### 4. Artifact System
**What artifacts are:**
- Documents
- Plans
- Screenshots
- Code files
- Implementation plans
- Browser recordings
- Test reports

**Why it matters:**
> "Every time an agent does something, it creates artifacts. Everything the agent does gets saved. You can open the implementation plan while the agent is working. You can review everything step by step."

**Collaboration feature:**
- Leave annotations on screenshots
- Comment on code
- Give feedback in real-time
- Agent sees comments and adjusts

---

### 5. Browser Control & Testing
**What it does:**
- Opens browser automatically
- Clicks buttons
- Fills out forms
- Takes screenshots
- Tests functionality
- Verifies everything works

**Why this is huge:**
> "The AI has full control over the browser. Because Google makes Chrome, they integrated it perfectly."

**Example:**
- Agent builds login form
- Opens browser
- Clicks through form
- Enters test data
- Takes screenshots
- Verifies it works
- All automatically

---

### 6. Model Flexibility
**Supported AI models:**
- **Gemini 3 Flash** (fast, free tier, best for quick iterations)
- **Gemini 3 Pro** (most powerful, better reasoning)
- **Claude Sonnet 4.5** (Anthropic's model)
- **Claude Opus 4.5** (now free!)
- **GPT-4o-OSS** (open-source option)

**Why multiple models:**
> "You extend your usage limits by switching between tools strategically. You get more done before hitting walls."

**Julian's recommendation:**
- **Gemini Flash:** Fast, doesn't hit limits as quickly, great for prototyping
- **Claude Opus 4.5:** Better for complex logic and fewer bugs
- **Gemini 3 Pro:** Best overall, but hits limits faster

---

## 📋 THE TWO VIEWS

### Editor View (Traditional Coding)
**What it looks like:**
- Looks like VS Code
- Code editor in center
- File tree on left
- Terminal at bottom
- Chat panel on right

**When to use:**
- Single-agent work
- Quick edits
- Simple projects

---

### Manager View (Mission Control)
**What it is:**
> "This is like a control center. You can see all your AI agents working. You can manage multiple projects at once. It's like being a manager of a whole team. But the team is AI."

**Three main sections:**
1. **Workspaces** (main projects)
2. **Playgrounds** (quick experiments)
3. **Inbox** (agent messages and updates)

**When to use:**
- Multi-agent projects
- Complex workflows
- Managing multiple clients
- Experimenting with ideas

## ⚡ PLANNING MODE vs FAST MODE

### Planning Mode
**When to use:**
- Complex projects
- First time building something
- Need detailed roadmap
- Want to review before execution

**What it does:**
- Creates detailed implementation plan
- Breaks down into steps
- Shows you plan before coding
- Asks clarifying questions
- More thoughtful output

**Julian's note:**
> "If you use planning mode first, you will get better outputs. It creates a more thoughtful approach."

---

### Fast Mode
**When to use:**
- Simple projects
- Quick iterations
- You know exactly what you want
- Prototyping ideas

**What it does:**
- Jumps straight to coding
- Faster execution
- Less planning overhead
- Good for simple tasks

---

## 🎯 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### 1. Visual Inspiration Method
**The problem:** AI sometimes builds generic UIs

**The solution:**
1. Go to **v0.dev** (UI generator)
2. Describe UI you want
3. V0 generates it in seconds
4. Take screenshot
5. Paste into Antigravity
6. Tell it: *"Use this as inspiration"*

**Result:** Much better UI design

---

### 2. Multi-Agent Coordination
**How to do it:**
1. Click "+" in Agent Manager
2. Create Agent 1: *"Build the portfolio feature"*
3. Create Agent 2: *"Add crypto tracking"*
4. Create Agent 3: *"Write marketing copy"*
5. All agents work in parallel

**Types of agents you can create:**
- Product manager agent (creates roadmap)
- Coding agent (writes code)
- Testing agent (runs tests)
- Marketing agent (writes blog posts, tweets)
- Documentation agent (creates docs)

**Julian's take:**
> "You can have a whole team of AI agents, each one doing different work. You're just managing them."

---

### 3. Playgrounds for Experiments
**Use case:**
- You're working on main app
- Suddenly have idea for a game
- Don't want to mess up main workspace

**Solution:**
- Go to Playground
- Create new experiment
- Tell AI to build it
- If you like it → move to workspace
- If not → delete it

---

### 4. Annotations for Real-Time Feedback
**How it works:**
- Agent testing your app
- You see screenshot
- Notice something you want to change
- Highlight part of screenshot
- Leave comment: *"Add crypto section here"*
- Agent sees comment
- Starts working on it immediately

**Translation:** Feedback loop is instant, not hours/days later

---

## 🔒 SAFETY & SECURITY (CRITICAL)

### The Scary Incident
**What happened:**
- Developer used Turbo Mode
- Agent started running terminal commands
- **Accidentally deleted entire hard drive**
- No warning
- Files just gone

**Why it happened:**
- Agents have full access to terminal
- Can run any command (including `rm -rf /`)
- Turbo mode skips approval steps

### Security Vulnerabilities Found
**Prompt injection attacks:**
- Bad actors hide malicious instructions in files
- When AI reads files, executes instructions
- Could steal API keys
- Could delete databases
- Could expose sensitive data

---

### Safety Rules (Julian's Recommendations)

**Rule 1:** Always back up your work
- Use Git for version control
- Commit frequently
- Push to remote (GitHub, GitLab)

**Rule 2:** Run in sandbox or VM
- Never run on production servers
- Use dedicated virtual machine
- Isolate from critical systems

**Rule 3:** Disable automatic destructive commands
- No automatic `rm -rf`
- No global `sudo` access
- Require manual approval for dangerous commands

**Rule 4:** Review evidence logs
- Check what agent did
- Read through artifacts
- Don't blindly trust

**Rule 5:** Use dummy credentials for testing
- Don't give real API keys to agents
- Don't connect to production databases
- Use test environments

**Rule 6:** Avoid Turbo Mode on important work
- Turbo mode = faster but dangerous
- Skips approval steps
- Only use for throwaway projects

**Julian's warning:**
> "Anti-gravity agents have a lot of power. They can edit code. They can run terminal commands. They can control your browser. This creates security risks."

- ❌ Old: "I need to know how to code to build tools"
- ✅ New: "I just need to describe what I want in plain English"

**Analogy:**
> "When you order food at a restaurant, do you need to know how to cook? No. You describe what you want. The kitchen makes it. Antigravity is the kitchen."

---

### 2. Time Investment
- ❌ Old: "Building custom tools takes weeks or months"
- ✅ New: "What used to take weeks now takes minutes"

**Why:**
> "The reason building used to take so long wasn't because the work itself was hard. It was because humans had to translate your ideas into code line by line. Now AI does the translation instantly."

---

### 3. Cost
- ❌ Old: "Free tools can't be that good"
- ✅ New: "The best AI tools are often free because big companies want you using them"

**Why:**
> "Google gives away powerful tools because they want you in their ecosystem. Gmail is free. Google Docs is free. Google search is free. Antigravity follows the same pattern."

---

### 4. Complexity
- ❌ Old: "Anti-gravity looks too advanced for me"
- ✅ New: "I can literally just type one sentence and it builds what I want"

---

### 5. Breaking Things
- ❌ Old: "I'm scared of breaking something"
- ✅ New: "Antigravity keeps history of everything. I can just undo."
