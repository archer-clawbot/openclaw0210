# Goldie AI SEO Accelerator Framework
**Source:** Julian Goldie live stream (AI SEO results)  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Context:** How Julian took his agency from 0 to 176 clicks/day using Claude + multi-platform publishing

---

## 🎯 THE RESULTS: 0 → 176 CLICKS/DAY

**What happened:**
- Agency website: 0 clicks/day → 176 clicks/day
- Started publishing: End of September (last year)
- Method: Every video turned into blog post
- Published across: YouTube, website, LinkedIn, Reddit
- Result: Rank 4-10x on page 1 for SAME keyword

**Timeline:**
- Literally zero clicks before September
- Started publishing consistently (end of September)
- Trajectory going up exponentially
- Now getting 176 clicks/day (and climbing)

**Proof:**
- Google Search Console screenshots
- Ahrefs data (DR 55 domain)
- Live examples ranking in Google, Perplexity, AI Overviews

---

## 🧠 THE GOLDIE AI SEO ACCELERATOR FRAMEWORK

**3 Core Components:**

1. **Claude AI for content creation**
   - Turn video transcripts into blog posts
   - Automated with prompt (team can do this with zero SEO experience)
   - Better than 99% of SEOs

2. **Low-competition keyword research**
   - Trending topics (brand new keywords)
   - Google autocomplete method
   - No expensive tools required (free)

3. **Strategic link building**
   - Natural backlinks through personal branding
   - Some outreach (but mostly natural now)
   - DR 55 domain (very powerful)

**The Magic:**
> "When you put these three things together, something magical happens. You stop fighting for impossible keywords. You start ranking fast. And you build momentum that compounds over time."

---

## 🥊 THE MUAY THAI ANALOGY

**Julian's approach to SEO:**
> "It's like how I approach Muay Thai training. I don't try to knock someone out in the first round. You set things up, you find the openings, you land strategic strikes that add up. Same with SEO."

**Translation:**
- Don't target "SEO agency" or "best plumber" (you'll lose)
- Target low-competition keywords (white belt vs white belt)
- Strategic strikes that add up over time
- Winnable fights = momentum

**Key insight:**
> "It's like a white belt walking into a Muay Thai gym and trying to fight a professional. Of course you're going to lose. But what if you fought other white belts? That's what low-competition keywords are. They're winnable fights."

---

## 📊 THE BACKLINK PROFILE (DR 55 Agency Site)

**Ahrefs Data:**
- Domain Rating: 55 (very powerful)
- Mix of natural + outreach backlinks
- Filter: One link per domain, dofollow only

**Example Natural Backlink:**
- **Source:** trafficthinktank.com (DR 70)
- **Link:** Listed as one of "Top 7 SEO Books"
- **Julian's reaction:** "I didn't even know I was on this list"
- **How it happened:** Personal branding (no outreach)

**Where backlinks point to:**
- Mix of homepage links
- Inner page links
- Landing page links
- No specific pattern (diversified)

**Why this works:**
> "The more backlinks you have, the more authority you have, the more likely you are to rank."

**Team size:** 50 people at agency, building links daily, never had a penalty

---

## 🎯 LOW-COMPETITION KEYWORD STRATEGY

### What Julian Targets

**NOT targeting:**
- "Best plumber Chicago"
- "SEO agency"
- "Electrician near me"
- Generic, high-competition keywords

**ACTUALLY targeting:**
- Notebook LM updates
- AI tool updates
- Hyper-specific, trending keywords
- Brand new topics (released within 24 hours)

**Example keyword Julian showed:**
- Super niche (didn't show exact keyword on stream)
- Ranking: #1 and #2 with two different pages
- Ranking: 4x total on page 1 of Google (YouTube x2, website x2, Reddit, LinkedIn)
- Also ranking: In AI Overviews (cited twice)
- Page created: 20 HOURS AGO

**How he finds them:**
- Google autocomplete (free)
- Trending AI topics (Notebook LM, Gemini, etc.)
- ChatGPT market research prompt (see below)

**Why autocomplete > tools:**
> "The reason I recommend finding keywords from autosuggest is you won't find accurate search volume for these keywords in Ahrefs. It's much better to go into autosuggest. Also, your team doesn't need to pay for tools. It's free."

---

## 🤖 THE CLAUDE CONTENT CREATION WORKFLOW

### Step-by-Step Process (Team Uses This)

**1. Create video** (YouTube, live stream, tutorial, etc.)

**2. Get transcript**
- Use YouTube auto-transcript
- Or Rev.com / other transcription service
- Copy full transcript

**3. Open Claude**
- Paste transcript
- Use Julian's prompt (see below)
- Insert target keyword

**4. Generate content**
- Claude outputs SEO-optimized blog post
- Automated structure (H1, H2s, H3s)
- Includes keyword naturally

**5. Proofread + checklist**
- Team reviews (not perfect, but 80-90% done)
- Quick edits
- Publish

**Team context:**
> "I have a team that have never done SEO before and they get results better than 99% of SEOs. Why? Because they're using the systems I've set up for them."

---

## 📝 THE EXACT CLAUDE PROMPT

**Julian's prompt structure:**

```
[Paste full video transcript here]

---

Turn this transcript into an SEO-optimized blog post targeting the keyword: [KEYWORD]

Include:
- H1 with keyword
- H2s and H3s (structured)
- Keyword naturally integrated
- Engaging, conversational tone
- Actionable takeaways
```

**Example:**
- Keyword: "Notebook LM and Gemini AI"
- Paste transcript from video
- Claude generates full blog post
- Team proofreads and publishes

**Why Claude > Gemini/ChatGPT:**
> "If I had a choice between Gemini and Claude, I'd go with Claude. The content is way better. More humanized and sentient."

**Can you use Gemini?**
> "Yeah, you can use the same prompt in Gemini. As long as you're not a perfectionist, you can still generate content that ranks. But Claude is better."

---

## 🌐 MULTI-PLATFORM PUBLISHING STRATEGY

### The Secret to Ranking 4-10x for Same Keyword

**Julian's approach:** Publish the same content across multiple platforms

**Platforms used:**
1. YouTube (main video)
2. Website blog (embed video + written content)
3. LinkedIn (article or post with embedded video)
4. Reddit (relevant subreddit)
5. Twitter/X (clips + links)

**Example result for one keyword:**
- YouTube video #1: Page 1
- YouTube video #2: Page 1
- Website blog post: Page 1
- LinkedIn article: Page 1
- Reddit thread: Page 1
- Google AI Overview: Cited 2x

**Total: 6+ placements on page 1 for ONE keyword**

**Why this works:**
> "We don't just get traffic to our website. We also get traffic to our videos from Google, and we also get traffic to our Reddit and LinkedIn. That's basically how it works."

---

## 🛡️ THE ANTI-FRAGILE SEO STRATEGY

**Problem with single-platform SEO:**
> "If you're creating content just on your website and something happens (Google changes algorithm), you lose all your traffic overnight."

**Julian's solution:** Multi-platform = unstoppable

**Example scenario:**
- Google decides: "We don't like Julian's website. We're going to mark him down."
- Julian's response: "No problem, mate."
  - 2x YouTube channels still ranking
  - Website still ranking
  - LinkedIn still ranking
  - Reddit still ranking

**Translation:** You become algorithm-proof.

**Key insight:**
> "In multiple different ways, from multiple different angles, and multiple different platforms, we're ranking our content. And so you become unstoppable."

---

## ⚡ SPEED: 20 HOURS TO RANK (Not 90 Days)

**Traditional SEO:**
- Create content
- Wait 90+ days
- Hope Google notices
- "We tell clients to expect 90 days minimum"

**Low-competition keyword SEO:**
- Create content
- Publish across platforms
- Rank in 20 HOURS (sometimes less)

**Real example Julian showed:**
- Page created: 20 hours ago
- Ranking: Page 1 of Google (multiple placements)
- Also ranking: AI Overviews, Perplexity

**Why so fast:**
- Low competition (no one else targeting these keywords)
- Fresh content (Google loves new updates on trending topics)
- Multi-platform signals (YouTube + website + LinkedIn + Reddit = stronger ranking signal)

---

## 🔍 KEYWORD RESEARCH: THE AUTOCOMPLETE METHOD

### Why Autocomplete > Keyword Tools

**Julian's take:**
> "I tend to find this actually works better than Ahrefs. You can go into Google autosuggest. You won't find accurate search volume for trending keywords in tools."

**Why?**
- Brand new keywords (released 24 hours ago)
- Not in keyword databases yet
- Autocomplete shows REAL searches happening NOW

**Example:**
- "Notebook LM" (type in Google)
- Autocomplete suggests:
  - "Notebook LM update"
  - "Notebook LM vs Gemini"
  - "Notebook LM make money"
  - "Notebook LM tutorial"

**Each autocomplete = potential video + blog post**

### ChatGPT Keyword Research Prompt

```
Act as a market researcher.

My niche is [SEO / AI / plumbing / real estate / etc.].

Find me 20 specific questions people are asking in this niche that I can create videos and blog posts to answer.

Make them specific and long-tail.
```

**What you get:**
- 20+ super specific questions
- "Almost too long-tail, but perfect for starting"
- Each = winnable keyword

---

## 📈 RANKING IN PERPLEXITY (8X FOR ONE KEYWORD)

**Example Julian showed:**
- Search: "Notebook LM make money"
- Perplexity pulls in multiple sources

**Julian's content ranking:**
- Website page #1
- Website page #2
- LinkedIn article
- YouTube video #1
- YouTube video #2
- Reddit thread
- (And more)

**Total: 8x citations in Perplexity for ONE keyword**

**How?**
> "I actually find it's easier now to create more content across more platforms, which gives you more opportunities to rank inside AI search engines as well as Google."

---

## 💡 MINDSET SHIFTS (OLD BELIEF → NEW BELIEF)

### 1. SEO Timeline
- ❌ Old: "SEO takes years to see results"
- ✅ New: "Low-competition keywords can rank in weeks (or days)"

**Why the old belief is wrong:**
> "People who say it takes years are targeting keywords they have no business targeting. It's like a white belt trying to fight a professional. But what if you fought other white belts? That's what low-competition keywords are."

### 2. Technical Skills
- ❌ Old: "You need to be technical to do SEO"
- ✅ New: "Claude AI handles all the technical stuff for you"

**Proof:**
> "I have a team that have never done SEO before and they get results better than 99% of SEOs. They just use Claude with my prompt."

### 3. Keyword Availability
- ❌ Old: "All the good keywords are taken"
- ✅ New: "New keywords appear every single day"

**Example:**
> "AI didn't exist as a mainstream topic three years ago. Now there are millions of searches around it. New industries pop up. New problems emerge. New solutions get created. Every single day there are fresh keywords with zero competition."

### 4. Link Building
- ❌ Old: "Link building is spammy and risky"
- ✅ New: "Strategic outreach builds real relationships and real rankings"

**Julian's take:**
> "Bad link building is spammy. Good link building is just networking. When I speak at events, I meet people. We exchange ideas. Sometimes we collaborate. That's link building, except you do it online."

**Track record:** 50-person team, building links daily, never had a penalty
