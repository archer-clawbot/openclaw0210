**Source:** Julian Goldie live stream on Reddit AI SEO  
**Date:** 2026-02-12  
**Context:** How to leverage Reddit's DR 91 authority to rank in Google + AI search engines within 24 hours

---

## 🎯 THE RESULTS: 70,000 VIEWS/MONTH FROM REDDIT

**Julian's subreddit (AI SEO Insider):**
- **70,000 views/month** on Reddit
- **3,800 members** (started a few months ago)
- **300+ posts** published
- **Quarter million views** this year
- **Free** to use (no ad spend)

**Growth timeline:**
- **January:** Literally zero (just started)
- **February:** Barely anything (slow burner)
- **Now:** 70,000+ views/month (exponential compound growth)

**Example post:**
- 2,500 views on one article
- Ranking in Perplexity AI search
- Ranking on Google
- Embedding YouTube video = 5x traffic sources

**Why this works:**
> "Reddit threads appear in 82% of Google searches on page one."

---

## 🚀 THE BIG SHIFT: GOOGLE'S REDDIT DEAL

**What happened:**
- Google signed a deal with Reddit
- Google gets access to Reddit's content for AI models
- Reddit gets boosted in search results
- ChatGPT also leveraging Reddit now

**The results:**
- Reddit saw **27% increase in ranking keywords**
- Added **110 million new keywords** to their rankings
- Reddit has **Domain Rating 91** (higher than Fortune 500 companies)

**What this means for you:**
> "When you post on Reddit, you're borrowing their authority. Your post can rank faster than a brand new website ever could."

**Speed:**
- Traditional SEO: 6-12 months to rank
- Reddit parasite SEO: **24 HOURS** (not days, not weeks, HOURS)

---

## 🧠 THE GOLDIE REDDIT PARASITE ENGINE

**Core framework:** Turn Reddit into a lead generation machine

**3-Step System:**

### Step 1: Create Subreddit (60 seconds)
- Go to reddit.com/subreddits/create
- Pick a niche-specific name
- Examples:
  - AI SEO Insider (Julian's)
  - E-commerce Growth Hacks (e-commerce niche)
  - Local Business AI (local business niche)

**Use Claude to generate subreddit names:**
```
Act as a branding expert.

My niche is [your niche].

Generate 20 subreddit name ideas that are:
- Catchy
- Niche-specific
- Easy to remember
- Professional

Format: r/[SubredditName]
```

---

### Step 2: Content Engine (Claude + Video Transcripts)

**The workflow:**

1. **Get video transcript**
   - YouTube video → Transcript (auto-generated or manual)
   - Copy full transcript

2. **Paste into Claude**
   - Open Claude
   - Paste transcript
   - Use prompt (see below)

3. **Claude generates Reddit post**
   - Structured article
   - Uses first-person perspective (trained on your content)
   - SEO-optimized
   - Engaging format

4. **Quality control**
   - Read what Claude created
   - Edit if needed
   - Publish to subreddit

**The Exact Claude Prompt:**
```
[Paste full video transcript here]

---

Turn this transcript into a high-quality Reddit post for r/[YourSubreddit].

Guidelines:
- Engaging, conversational tone
- First-person perspective (like I'm the one writing it)
- Break into sections with clear headings
- Include actionable takeaways
- 800-1200 words
- SEO-optimized for [target keyword]
- No fluff, straight to value

Format:
- Hook (first 2 sentences grab attention)
- Body (sections with H2 headings)
- Conclusion (CTA or question to drive engagement)
```

**Why this works:**
- Uses YOUR content (not generic AI)
- Trained on YOUR case studies
- Maintains YOUR voice
- First-person = authentic

---

### Step 3: Multi-Platform Publishing (5x Traffic)

**Don't just post on Reddit. Post everywhere:**

1. **Reddit** (main subreddit post)
2. **Your website** (blog post with embedded video)
3. **LinkedIn** (article or post)
4. **YouTube** (embed video in Reddit post)
5. **Perplexity/AI Search** (auto-indexed from Reddit/website)

**Example result for ONE piece of content:**
- Reddit: 2,500 views
- Google: Ranking on page 1
- Perplexity: Cited as source
- YouTube: Views from Reddit traffic
- Website: Traffic from blog post

**Total: 5x traffic sources from ONE content piece**

---

## 📊 REDDIT'S INSANE AUTHORITY

**Reddit stats:**
- **Domain Rating:** 91 (higher than most Fortune 500 sites)
- **Daily active users:** 108 million
- **Monthly visits:** 2 billion
- **Google search presence:** 82% of page 1 searches have a Reddit thread

**Why Reddit ranks so fast:**
> "Google already trusts Reddit. So when you post, Google trusts you instantly."

**Translation:** You're not building authority from scratch. You're borrowing Reddit's DR 91.

---

## ⚡ SPEED: 24 HOURS TO RANK (Not 12 Months)

**Traditional SEO timeline:**
- Build website from scratch
- Wait 12 months for Google to trust you
- Write 100 blog posts manually
- Build backlinks one by one
- Compete against massive sites
- Pay for ads to get attention
- Hire writers or spend hours creating content
- Hope Google doesn't penalize you

**Reddit parasite SEO timeline:**
- Create subreddit in 60 seconds
- Borrow Reddit's DR 91 authority
- Let Claude write content
- Automate posting with free tools
- Rank within 24 hours
- Zero ad spend
- No technical skills needed
- Google is literally pushing Reddit to page 1

**Real example:**
- Post created: 3 months ago
- Still ranking in Perplexity today
- Still getting views today
- Traffic only increases over time (never decreases)

**Key insight:**
> "You're creating assets that can generate more traffic, more leads, more sales over the long term."

---

## 🎯 THE COMPOUND EFFECT

**Julian's growth curve:**

**January (Month 1):**
- Just started
- Zero views
- Crickets

**February (Month 2):**
- Barely anything
- Slow start
- Frustrating

**March-Present:**
- 70,000 views/month
- 3,800 members
- Quarter million views this year
- Exponential growth

**Why it compounds:**
- Content doesn't expire (unlike paid ads)
- Old posts still rank (3-month-old post still in Perplexity)
- More content = more authority
- More authority = faster rankings
- Faster rankings = more traffic
- More traffic = more members
- More members = more engagement
- More engagement = higher rankings

**Translation:** Slow start, exponential payoff.

**Julian's take:**
> "I actually thought it was too late and wouldn't work. Then it began to take off."

## 💡 LIMITING BELIEFS → NEW BELIEFS

### 1. Writing Skills
- ❌ Old: "I need to be a good writer to create content"
- ✅ New: "I'm the creative director. AI is my writing team."

**Example:** Richard Branson is dyslexic. Can't write. Built a billion-dollar empire. How? He surrounds himself with people and tools that do what he can't.

**Your role:**
- Be a good editor (not a good writer)
- Read what Claude creates
- Fix what needs fixing
- Publish

---

### 2. SEO Speed
- ❌ Old: "SEO takes too long. I don't have patience for 6-12 months."
- ✅ New: "I can rank fast by borrowing authority from platforms Google already trusts."

**Why Reddit is different:**
- Rank in 24 hours (not 24 months)
- Borrow Reddit's DR 91
- Google already trusts Reddit
- You get instant trust

**Translation:** This is the shortcut. This is the hack.

---

### 3. Reddit's Reputation
- ❌ Old: "Reddit is for nerds and memes. It won't work for my business."
- ✅ New: "My ideal customers are already on Reddit. I just need to show up and help them."

**Reddit stats:**
- 108 million daily active users
- 2 billion monthly visits
- Subreddit for literally everything:
  - Real estate
  - B2B software
  - Fitness coaching
  - Digital marketing
  - Local SEO
  - E-commerce
  - Plumbing
  - Restaurants

**Translation:** Your customers are already there. Just show up.

**Bonus traffic source:**
- Not just Google traffic
- Not just AI search traffic
- Also direct Reddit platform traffic
- Triple threat
