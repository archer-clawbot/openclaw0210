# LocalCatalyst Lead Magnets, Funnels & Entry Offers

**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Purpose:** Build complete customer acquisition funnel from traffic → lead → low-ticket sale → full-service client  
**Goal:** Lower CAC, increase conversion rate, create multiple entry points  

---

## The Problem With "Free Audit" Only

**Current approach:** Traffic → Free Audit → $2,000/month service

**Problems:**
1. **High friction** — Asking for $2k/month is a big ask for cold traffic
2. **Low conversion** — Only 10-20% of leads who get free audit actually buy
3. **Expensive CAC** — Paying $30-50 CPC for leads who don't convert
4. **No nurture** — People who aren't ready now are lost forever

**Solution:** Multi-step funnel with lead magnets, email nurture, and low-ticket entry offers

### **Sequence 1: Lead Magnet Delivery (7 emails)**

**Email 1 (Immediate): Welcome + Deliver**
```
Subject: Here's your [Lead Magnet Name]

**Email 2 (Day 2): Education — How Local SEO Works**
```
Subject: How Google decides who ranks #1 (it's not what you think)

[Name],

Most business owners think Google ranks businesses based on:
- Who pays the most for ads ❌
- Who has the most keywords on their website ❌
- Who's been around longest ❌

Wrong.

Google ranks businesses based on 3 factors:
1. Relevance (does your GBP + website match what people search?)
2. Distance (how close are you to the searcher?)
3. Prominence (reviews, citations, backlinks, engagement)

The businesses that dominate all 3 get the top spots.

Example: [Client Name] was #17 for "[keyword]" → We optimized all 3 factors → Now #2 → 300% more customers.

Want to see where YOUR business ranks? Reply "audit" and I'll send you a free spot-check (no strings attached).

- Cody
```

**Email 3 (Day 4): Case Study — Social Proof**
```
Subject: How [Client Name] went from invisible → #1 in 90 days

[Name],

Quick story:

[Client Name] (restaurant in Houston) was getting 20-30 website visitors/month. Barely anyone found them on Google.

We did 4 things:
1. Fixed their Google Business Profile (incomplete → 100% complete + 50 photos)
2. Got them 47 Google reviews (had 3 → now have 50)
3. Wrote 12 blog posts optimized for local keywords
4. Built 28 local citations + backlinks

90 days later:
- 12,000 website visitors/month (up 400x)
- #1-3 for 47 keywords
- 80+ phone calls/month from Google

```

**Email 4 (Day 6): Problem/Solution — Why DIY Fails**
```
Subject: Why "DIY SEO" almost never works

[Name],

I see this all the time:

Business owner watches YouTube videos, reads blog posts, tries to "do SEO themselves."

6 months later → still not ranking.

Here's why:

1. SEO is 100+ moving parts (GBP, content, citations, links, technical, reviews, schema)
2. It's not just "what to do" — it's "in what order" and "how much"
3. Google updates algorithms constantly (what worked last year doesn't work now)
4. Most DIY guides are generic (not specific to your industry/location)

Example: Restaurant SEO ≠ Dentist SEO ≠ Plumber SEO.

The tactics are similar, but the keywords, content, and strategy are completely different.

That's why most business owners hire us. It's faster, cheaper (your time = money), and actually works.

If you're tired of spinning your wheels, let's build your custom plan: $99 audit [Link]

```

**Email 5 (Day 8): Objection Handling — "Is SEO Worth It?"**
```
Subject: "Is SEO worth $2,000/month?"

[Name],

I get asked this a lot.

Let's do the math:

Average local service business:
- Customer value: $500-2,000
- Lifetime value: $2,000-10,000 (if they come back)

If SEO gets you 10 new customers/month = $5,000-20,000 in revenue.

And you're paying $2,000/month for SEO.

That's a 2.5x-10x return. Every month.

Plus, SEO compounds. Once you rank, you stay there (with maintenance). Ads stop the second you stop paying.

Example: [Client] has been ranking #1-3 for 2 years. Still getting 80+ calls/month. They've made $500k+ from SEO at this point.

Total investment: $48k (2 years × $2k/month).
Total return: $500k+.

10x ROI.

That's why SEO is worth it.

## Database Scraping Strategy

### **Goal:** Build 10,000+ lead database for cold email + retargeting

### **Tools for Scraping**

**1. Apollo.io ($49-99/month)**
- Best for: B2B contact data (business owners, marketing managers)
- Filters: Industry, location, company size, job title, revenue
- Export: CSV with name, email, phone, company, website
- Limit: 10,000 contacts/month on Growth plan

**2. Hunter.io ($49-149/month)**
- Best for: Finding email addresses for specific domains
- Use case: You have a list of businesses, need their emails
- Chrome extension: Find emails while browsing websites

**3. Instant Data Scraper (Chrome Extension, Free)**
- Best for: Scraping Google Maps results
- Use case: Search "restaurants in Houston" → scrape business names, addresses, phones, websites
- Export: CSV
- Limitation: Manual (you have to run searches yourself)

**4. Outscraper ($29/month)**
- Best for: Bulk Google Maps scraping
- Use case: "plumbers in texas" → scrapes all GBP listings (name, address, phone, website, reviews, hours)
- Export: CSV
- Limit: 20,000 results/month

**5. Phantombuster ($59/month)**
- Best for: LinkedIn scraping
- Use case: Extract LinkedIn profiles who match your ICP (industry, job title, location)
- Export: CSV with name, email (if public), LinkedIn URL, company

---

### **Scraping Workflow**

**Step 1: Define Your ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)**
- Industries: Restaurants, dentists, chiropractors, plumbers, electricians, lawyers
- Location: Texas, Arizona, Illinois, Colorado, Georgia, Nevada (major metros)
- Company size: 5-50 employees
- Revenue: $1M-10M/year
- Decision-maker: Owner, CEO, Marketing Director, Operations Manager

**Step 2: Scrape Business Lists**

**Option A: Apollo.io (Fastest, most accurate)**
```
Search criteria:
- Industry: "Restaurants", "Medical & Healthcare", "Home Services", "Legal"
- Location: Houston, Dallas, Austin, San Antonio, Phoenix, Chicago
- Company size: 5-50 employees
- Revenue: $1M-10M
- Job title: Owner, CEO, Marketing Director

Export 10,000 contacts (Apollo limit)
```

**Option B: Outscraper (Google Maps)**
```
Searches:
- "restaurants in Houston TX"
- "dentists in Dallas TX"
- "plumbers in Phoenix AZ"
- "chiropractors in Chicago IL"

For each search:
- Scrape all GBP listings (name, address, phone, website, reviews)
- Export CSV
- Combine all CSVs (5,000-10,000 businesses total)
```

**Option C: LinkedIn + Phantombuster**
```
LinkedIn search:
- Job title: Owner, CEO
- Industry: Restaurants, Healthcare, Home Services
- Location: Texas, Arizona, Illinois

Phantombuster:
- Extract profile data (name, company, email if public, LinkedIn URL)
- Export CSV (5,000+ profiles)
```

**Step 3: Enrich Data (Find Emails)**

If scraping gives you business names/websites but no emails:
- Use Hunter.io "Domain Search" to find emails for each domain
- OR: Use email pattern guessing (firstname@domain.com, first.last@domain.com)
- OR: Hire VA on Upwork to manually find emails ($5/hour, 20-30 emails/hour)

**Step 4: Clean & Verify**

- Remove duplicates (Excel/Google Sheets)
- Verify emails with ZeroBounce or NeverBounce ($16/1,000 emails)
- Remove role emails (info@, admin@, noreply@) — keep personal emails only
- Segment by industry, location (for personalized cold emails)

**Final result:** 5,000-10,000 verified leads ready for cold email campaigns

## Ad Creative Strategy

### **Google Ads Creative**

**Already covered in main plan**, but here's enhanced version:

**Headline variations (test all):**
- "Local SEO Services - 600% Avg Growth"
- "Rank #1 on Google Maps in 90 Days"
- "Get More Customers from Google Search"
- "Local SEO for [Industry] - Proven Results"
- "SEO Agency for [City] Businesses"

**Description variations:**
- "Proven local SEO system: audit → optimize → rank. 20+ case studies. Free SEO audit + custom 90-day plan. Book your call today."
- "Dominate Google Maps & local search. We've ranked 20+ businesses #1-3. Industry-specific strategies for restaurants, medical, home services. Get your $99 audit now."

**Landing page A/B test:**
- **Version A:** "Book Free Audit" (current)
- **Version B:** "Download Free Local SEO Checklist" (lead magnet)
- **Version C:** "$99 Audit (Normally $500)" (entry offer)

Hypothesis: Version B (lead magnet) will have higher conversion rate but lower purchase intent. Version C (paid audit) will have lower conversion but higher quality leads.

```

## Sales Strategy for Entry Offers

### **$99 Audit Sales Script**

**When lead books call:**

**Opening:**
"Hey [Name], this is Cody from LocalCatalyst. Thanks for booking the audit. I have your report ready — excited to walk you through what I found. Sound good?"

**Present findings (10 min):**
- "Okay, so I analyzed your website, your competitors, and your local market. Here's what I found..."
- [Share screen, show audit report]
- "The good news: Your [something positive]. The bad news: You're losing [X customers/month] because of [3-5 issues]."

**Explain impact (3 min):**
- "If we fix these issues, here's what happens: You'll rank #1-3 for [keywords], which means [X more visitors], which means [Y more customers], which is worth [$Z in revenue]."

**Present solution (5 min):**
- "So here's what I recommend: We handle all the fixes over the next 90 days. You don't have to do anything. We'll audit → optimize → rank → report monthly."
- "The investment is $2,000/month for 6 months minimum. Most clients see ROI within 60-90 days."

**Handle objections (5 min):**
- **"That's expensive."** → "I get it. Let's do the math: If this gets you 10 new customers/month @ $500 each, that's $5,000/month in revenue. You're paying $2k. That's a 2.5x return. Every month."
- **"I need to think about it."** → "Totally understand. What specifically do you need to think about? Budget? Timeline? Strategy? Let's talk through it now."
- **"I want to try DIY first."** → "I respect that. But here's the thing: DIY usually takes 6-12 months to see results, IF you do everything right. We can do it in 90 days. Your time is worth money too."

**Close:**
- "So are you ready to move forward? I can send the proposal today and we'll kick off within 48 hours."
- If yes → Send proposal immediately
- If no → "No problem. I'll send the proposal anyway so you have it. Take 24-48 hours to think about it. Fair?"

**Follow-up:**
- Day 1: Send proposal
- Day 2: "Have you had a chance to review the proposal?"
- Day 4: "Last check-in — still interested or should I close this out?"
- Day 7: Move to nurture sequence (1 email/week for 3 months)

## Expected Results (With Lead Magnets + Entry Offers)

### **Funnel Metrics (Month 1-3)**

**Traffic:** 10,000 ad clicks (Google + Facebook + LinkedIn)  
**Lead Magnet Downloads:** 2,000 (20% conversion)  
**Email Subscribers:** 2,000  
**Email Nurture → Paid Audit:** 200 (10% conversion)  
**Paid Audit → Full Service:** 60 clients (30% conversion)  

**Revenue:**
- Paid audits: 200 × $99 = $19,800
- Full service: 60 × $2,000 = $120,000 MRR

**Total:** $120k MRR from 60 clients (vs 30 clients without lead magnets/entry offers)

**CAC:** $29,310 / 60 clients = $489 per client (vs $977 without funnels)

**Why this works:** Lead magnets capture people who aren't ready to buy yet. Email nurture builds trust. Entry offers qualify serious buyers. Result: 2x more clients, half the CAC.
