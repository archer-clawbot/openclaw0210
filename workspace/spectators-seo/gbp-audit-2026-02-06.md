## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Harvest Green Missing Location Name
**Issue:** Business name is just "Spectators Bar & Grill" without "Harvest Green" identifier
**Impact:** Hurts local SEO, confuses customers searching for specific location
**Fix:** Update business name to "Spectators Bar & Grill - Harvest Green"

### 2. Inconsistent Category
**Issue:** All 3 listed as generic "Bar & grill"
**Recommendation:** Add secondary categories:
- Sports bar
- American restaurant
- Grill (already have)

### 3. Review Gap
**Issue:** Harvest Green (144) and Riverstone (191) have significantly fewer reviews than Lake Pointe (385)
**Recommendation:** Implement review generation campaign at underperforming locations

### 4. Riverstone Lower Rating
**Issue:** Riverstone at 4.4 vs 4.5-4.6 for others
**Recommendation:** Review recent negative feedback, identify operational issues
