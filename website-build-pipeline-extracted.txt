Autonomous Website Build Pipeline
Full Agent-Driven Site Design, Build, Review & Launch
Version 2.0 | 2026-02-07

Vision
Clients go from signed agreement to live website with near-zero manual work from you. The agent stack handles design, content, development, SEO optimization, staging, client review, revisions, and launch. Your role is oversight — a final QC glance and the occasional client call.

PART 1: THE NEW AGENT — CANVAS (Design)
Why a Dedicated Design Agent
Builder assembles WordPress pages from templates and content. But someone needs to decide what those templates look like — color palette, typography, layout structure, spacing, visual hierarchy, image treatment. That's design, and it's a different skillset from CMS assembly.

Canvas bridges the gap between "we have the client's logo and brand colors" and "here's a fully designed page layout Builder can implement."
Canvas — Agent Profile
AGENT: Canvas

ROLE: Visual design system creation and art direction

MODEL: Claude Sonnet (with image generation capability via API)

TIER: Execution agent (reports to Archer, coordinates with Builder)

WHAT CANVAS DOES:

  1. Takes client brand assets (logo, colors, existing materials)

     and creates a complete design system

  2. Generates page layout specifications that Builder follows

  3. Selects and curates stock photography / generates image assets

  4. Creates visual mockups for client review

  5. Defines responsive behavior (how layouts adapt to mobile)

  6. Ensures visual consistency across all pages

WHAT CANVAS DOES NOT DO:

  - Write content (that's Scribe)

  - Build WordPress pages (that's Builder)

  - Handle SEO (that's Silas/Specs)

  - Talk to clients (that's you via GHL)
Canvas Output: The Design System Document
For every client, Canvas produces a design system that Builder follows exactly:

─────────────────────────────────

Canvas produces one of these for every page type: homepage, service page, location page, about page, staff page, contact page, FAQ page, blog index, and blog post template.
Canvas + Stock Photography
Canvas handles image selection and procurement:

Option 1: Client-Provided Photos

Client sends photos in intake form
Canvas evaluates quality, selects best ones for each placement
Canvas specifies cropping, sizing, and treatment for each

Option 2: Stock Photography (Most Common)

Canvas searches and selects images from stock sources
Unsplash API (free, high-quality) for general photography
Pexels API (free) as backup
For medical/professional images that need to look authentic: Canvas generates detailed image descriptions → you approve → purchase from Shutterstock/iStock ($10-15/image) or use a subscription ($29/month for 10 images)

Option 3: AI-Generated Images

Canvas generates custom images via API (DALL-E, Midjourney, etc.)
Best for: abstract graphics, icons, pattern backgrounds
NOT recommended for: staff photos, office photos (clients should provide real photos or hire a photographer)
Canvas Model Choice
Canvas runs on Claude Sonnet for the design system generation (structured output, consistent formatting, design logic). For any image generation tasks, Canvas calls external APIs (DALL-E, Midjourney via API, or Ideogram).

Canvas does NOT need Opus. Design system creation is a structured, rules-based task once you establish the patterns. The first 2-3 builds, you'll review and refine Canvas's output. After that, Canvas produces consistent, professional design systems on autopilot.


PART 2: HOSTING INFRASTRUCTURE
Requirements
The agents need hosting they can manage programmatically — no clicking through cPanel. This means API-accessible hosting where Builder can:

Create new WordPress installations
Manage staging environments
Deploy staging to production
Handle SSL certificates
Manage DNS (or at least point domains)
Push files, run WP-CLI commands
Monitor uptime and performance
Recommended Stack: Cloudways
Why Cloudways:

Full REST API for everything (server management, app management, staging)
Built-in staging environments (one-click clone to staging, one-click push to live)
Managed security, backups, SSL
Runs on DigitalOcean, Vultr, or AWS underneath (you choose)
WordPress-optimized stack (Apache/Nginx, Varnish, Memcached, PHP 8.x)
$14-28/month per app on DigitalOcean (cheapest tier handles most small business sites)
No per-site pricing — you pay for server resources and run multiple sites

Alternative: RunCloud + DigitalOcean

RunCloud is a server management panel with API access ($8-15/month)
Paired with DigitalOcean droplets ($6-24/month per server)
More manual setup but cheaper at scale
Good option once you have 10+ client sites on one server

Alternative: SpinupWP + DigitalOcean

Similar to RunCloud, WordPress-specific
Clean API, good staging support
$12/month per server

Recommendation: Start with Cloudways. The API is the most complete, staging is built-in, and the managed layer means you don't have to deal with server maintenance. Switch to RunCloud + DO when you want to optimize costs at 15+ sites.
Cloudways API — What Builder Uses
BASE URL: https://api.cloudways.com/api/v1

AUTHENTICATION:

  POST /oauth/access_token

  → Returns bearer token for all subsequent calls

CREATE NEW WORDPRESS APP:

  POST /app

  {

    "server_id": "your_server_id",

    "application": "wordpress",

    "app_label": "client-name",

    "project_name": "client-name"

  }

STAGING OPERATIONS:

  POST /staging/app/{app_id}        → Create staging copy

  POST /staging/app/{app_id}/deploy  → Push staging to live

  DELETE /staging/app/{app_id}       → Remove staging

SSL CERTIFICATE:

  POST /security/lets_encrypt

  {

    "server_id": "...",

    "app_id": "...",

    "ssl_email": "your@email.com"

  }

SSH/SFTP ACCESS:

  Built-in SSH access per application

  Builder uses SSH to run WP-CLI commands:

    wp plugin install rank-math-seo --activate

    wp theme install flavor --activate

    wp option update blogname "Client Business Name"

GIT DEPLOYMENT (optional):

  POST /git  → Connect Git repo for version-controlled deployments
Server Architecture
CLOUDWAYS SERVER (DigitalOcean — 2GB RAM, $28/month)

│

├── App 1: client-a.com (production)

│   └── Staging: staging-client-a.cloudways.com

│

├── App 2: client-b.com (production)

│   └── Staging: staging-client-b.cloudways.com

│

├── App 3: client-c.com (production)

│   └── Staging: staging-client-c.cloudways.com

│

└── ... (can host 10-15 small business sites per 2GB server)

SCALING:

  5-10 clients: 1 server ($28/month)

  10-20 clients: 2 servers ($56/month)

  20+ clients: Consider dedicated resources per high-traffic site
Per-Client Hosting Cost
Component | Cost | Notes
Cloudways (shared server) | $2-5/month per site | Based on $28/month server / 6-15 sites
Domain (if you manage) | $12-15/year | Clients usually own their own domain
SSL | $0 | Free Let's Encrypt via Cloudways
CDN (Cloudflare) | $0 | Free tier is sufficient
Backups | $0 | Included in Cloudways


Option A: Client pays hosting directly

You set up the Cloudways app under their account or bill them
Cleanest separation — they own their hosting, you manage it
If they leave, they keep everything

Option B: You include hosting in your retainer (recommended)

Add $10-15/month to your retainer price to cover hosting overhead
Simpler for the client — one invoice, you handle everything
Gives you more control over the technical environment
If they leave, you migrate their site to their own hosting


PART 3: STAGING & DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT
How Staging Works
Every new site build happens on a staging URL that's publicly accessible (for client review) but not indexed by search engines.

STAGING ENVIRONMENT:

  URL: [client-name].staging.youragency.com

       or: staging-[randomhash].cloudways.com (Cloudways default)

  

  Features:

  - Full WordPress installation, identical to production

  - Not indexed (robots.txt: Disallow /, noindex headers)

  - Password-protected (optional, for sensitive clients)

  - All forms work but notifications go to a test inbox

  - Analytics/Search Console NOT installed (prevents polluting data)

  

  Accessible by:

  - All agents (Builder, Canvas, Scribe, Specs, Silas — via API/SSH)

  - You (for QC review)

  - Client (for review and feedback — via a clean preview link)
Staging Workflow
PHASE 1: Builder creates WordPress app on Cloudways via API

         URL: staging-clientname.cloudways.com

         │

PHASE 2: Builder installs theme, plugins, configures settings

         Canvas's design system applied (colors, fonts, layout specs)

         │

PHASE 3: Builder creates all pages using Canvas layouts + Scribe content

         Images placed, forms configured, navigation built

         │

PHASE 4: Specs runs technical SEO setup on staging

         Schema, speed optimization, accessibility

         │

PHASE 5: Silas audits staging site against SEO spec rubrics

         Scores each page, flags issues

         │

PHASE 6: Builder fixes any issues Silas flagged

         │

PHASE 7: Silas re-audits, confirms pass

         │

PHASE 8: YOU do visual QC (15-30 min)

         │

PHASE 9: Client review via preview link

         │

PHASE 10: Revisions (if any) → Agents execute → Re-review

          │

PHASE 11: Client approves → Builder deploys staging to production

          DNS pointed, SSL activated, redirects implemented

          │

PHASE 12: Post-launch verification (Specs + Scout)
Staging Access for Agents
Builder needs SSH/WP-CLI access to the staging environment. Here's how each agent interacts:

BUILDER:

  Access: SSH + WP-CLI + WordPress REST API + SFTP

  Can: Install plugins, activate themes, create/edit pages and posts,

       upload media, configure settings, manage menus, deploy to production

  

CANVAS:

  Access: None directly — Canvas outputs design specs and image files

  Builder: Consumes Canvas's output and implements it in WordPress

SCRIBE:

  Access: None directly — Scribe outputs structured content files

  Builder: Consumes Scribe's content and populates WordPress pages

SPECS:

  Access: SSH + WP-CLI (read/write)

  Can: Install/configure SEO plugins, edit robots.txt, submit sitemaps,

       add schema markup, optimize images, configure caching, run

       performance tests

SILAS:

  Access: HTTP (read-only) + WordPress REST API (read-only)

  Can: Crawl the staging site, audit pages, validate schema,

       check page speed, score against spec rubrics

  Cannot: Make changes (Silas reviews, Builder/Specs fix)

SCOUT:

  Access: HTTP (read-only)

  Can: Crawl staging to map URL structure, verify content is present,

       check competitor comparison data


PART 4: CLIENT REVIEW & FEEDBACK SYSTEM
The Review Portal
Clients need a simple, non-technical way to review their staging site and provide feedback. They should NOT be logging into WordPress or Cloudways.

Solution: Dedicated Review Page in GHL Portal

When the staging site is ready, the client gets:

GHL → CLIENT (SMS + Email):

"Hi [First Name], your new website is ready for review! 🎉

Preview your site here: [staging URL]

When you're done reviewing, share your feedback here:

[GHL feedback form link]

You can:

✅ Approve the site to go live

✏️ Request specific changes (tell us exactly what to adjust)

We'll have any changes made within 48 hours."
The Feedback Form (GHL Custom Form)
WEBSITE REVIEW — [Client Name]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Have you reviewed the full site on both your 

phone and computer?

  ○ Yes

  ○ Not yet (we recommend reviewing on both before submitting)

OVERALL IMPRESSION:

  ○ Love it — approve to go live

  ○ Mostly good — a few changes needed

  ○ Needs significant changes — let's discuss

SPECIFIC FEEDBACK (if changes needed):

Homepage:

[text field — "What would you change on the homepage?"]

Service Pages:

[text field — "Any changes to service descriptions or pages?"]

About / Team Page:

[text field — "Any corrections to bios, photos, or company info?"]

Contact / Hours:

[text field — "Are contact details and hours correct?"]

Photos & Images:

[text field — "Any photos to add, remove, or replace?"]

Colors & Design:

[text field — "Any changes to colors, fonts, or overall look?"]

Other:

[text field — "Anything else?"]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Feedback → Agent Execution Pipeline
CLIENT SUBMITS FEEDBACK FORM

       │

       ▼

GHL: Captures form submission

  - Tags contact: "site-review-submitted"

  - Webhook to Archer with form data

       │

       ▼

ARCHER: Parses feedback

       │

       ├── "Approve to go live" selected?

       │   → YES: Move to launch sequence (Part 5)

       │   → Add to YOUR Trello: "Client approved — ready for launch"

       │

       └── "Changes needed" selected?

           → Archer parses each feedback field

           → Creates Trello cards for each change request

           → Routes to appropriate agent:

               │

               ├── Content changes → Scribe revises → Builder updates

               ├── Design/visual changes → Canvas adjusts specs → Builder updates

               ├── Photo changes → Canvas selects new images → Builder swaps

               ├── Factual corrections (hours, names, etc.) → Builder direct edit

               └── Structural changes (add/remove pages) → Full pipeline re-run for affected pages

           │

           ▼

       ALL CHANGES COMPLETE

           │

           ▼

       SILAS: Re-audits changed pages (SEO compliance check)

           │

           ▼

       GHL → CLIENT: "We've made the changes you requested. 

              Take another look: [staging URL]

              [feedback form link]"

           │

           ▼

       (Repeat until approved — max 2 rounds included in price,

        additional rounds $250 each per the build agreement)
Handling Vague Feedback
Clients sometimes give feedback like "I don't love it" or "can you make it more modern?" without specifics.

IF FEEDBACK IS VAGUE:

  1. Archer flags it on YOUR Trello board:

     "🟡 Vague client feedback — needs clarification"

  2. You reach out personally:

     "Hey [First Name], thanks for the feedback! To make 

      sure we nail the changes, can you help me understand 

      a bit more about what you'd like different? For 

      example:

      - Are there specific pages that need work?

      - Is it the colors, layout, photos, or text?

      - Do you have examples of sites you like the look of?"

  3. Once clarified → route to agents as normal
Review Timeline Expectations
Set these at the start of the project (in the intake call and the build agreement):

STAGING READY → Client has 5 business days to review

  Day 1: Preview link sent

  Day 3: Nudge if no response: "Just checking in — have 

         you had a chance to review the site?"

  Day 5: "Your review period closes tomorrow. If we don't 

         hear from you, we'll proceed with launch."

  Day 6: If no response → You call them

  Day 8: If still no response → Auto-approve 

         (per agreement terms, disclosed upfront)

  

CHANGES REQUESTED → Agents complete within 48 hours

  → Client gets another 3 business days to re-review

  → Same nudge sequence


PART 5: THE FULL BUILD PIPELINE (Start to Launch)
Phase 0: Project Kickoff (Day 1)
TRIGGER: Agreement signed + 50% deposit received

ARCHER:

  1. Create Trello board for the website build project

     (separate from ongoing SEO board — this is a project board)

  2. Populate with all build phases as lists

  3. Create Cloudways staging app via API

  4. Send client intake form via GHL

  5. Notify you: "Website build initiated for [Client Name]"

  6. Dispatch Scout for research phase

SCOUT:

  - Audit existing site (if migrating) — crawl all URLs,

    identify ranked pages, export backlink profile

  - Competitor website analysis (top 3 local competitors)

  - Industry website benchmarks

  - Full keyword map (service × location matrix)

MOZI:

  - Review Scout's findings

  - Define Grand Slam positioning for the site

  - Recommend site architecture based on keyword opportunities

  - Define conversion strategy and CTA hierarchy
Phase 1: Client Materials + Architecture (Day 1-7)
CLIENT: Completes intake form (GHL)

  - Business info, brand assets, content inputs, preferences

  - GHL automation: Tag "intake-complete" when form submitted

  - If intake not complete by Day 5: GHL nudge sequence

SILAS: Creates site architecture

  Based on: Scout keyword map + Mozi strategy + client inputs

  Output:

  - Complete sitemap with URL structure

  - Keyword-to-page mapping

  - Internal linking architecture

  - Content brief for each page (target keyword, word count,

    required sections, CTA, schema type)

YOU: Review architecture (15 min)

  - Verify it makes sense for the client's business

  - Approve or adjust

  - Send to client for sign-off (via GHL approval workflow)

  - Client has 48 hours to approve (auto-approve applies)
Phase 2: Design System (Day 5-9)
CANVAS: Creates complete design system

  Input: Client brand assets, design preferences from intake,

         competitor analysis, industry benchmarks

  Output:

  - Full design system document (colors, typography, spacing,

    components — see Part 1)

  - Page layout specifications for every page type

  - Image selection/curation for the site

  - Responsive behavior specs

YOU: Review design system (10 min)

  - Does it look professional?

  - Does it match the client's brand and preferences?

  - Quick gut check — would you be proud to show this?

  

  If Canvas is consistently producing good systems (after 

  the first 2-3 builds), skip this review and let it flow

  straight to Builder.
Phase 3: Content Generation (Day 7-12)
SCRIBE: Generates all page content

  Input: Silas's content briefs + client intake materials

  Output: Structured content files for every page

  

  Runs in parallel with Canvas (Phase 2) — both can work 

  simultaneously since they don't depend on each other.

YOU: Review content (1-2 hours, batch all pages at once)

  - Accuracy check (especially for medical/legal content)

  - Brand voice consistency

  - Approve or request revisions from Scribe

  

  Trello: All content cards in "Needs My Review"

  You: Move to "Approved" or "Needs Revision" with notes

  If revision needed: Scribe fixes → re-review (usually one round)
Phase 4: WordPress Build (Day 10-17)
BUILDER: Assembles the complete site on staging

  Input: Canvas design system + Scribe content + Silas architecture

  

  Day 10-11: Foundation

    - WordPress installed on Cloudways staging (via API)

    - Theme installed and configured per Canvas design system

  Day 17: Builder self-check

    - Automated QC (all pages load, forms submit, links work,

      images have alt text, mobile responsive)

    - Flag any issues for Specs/Silas
Phase 5: Technical SEO & Quality Audit (Day 17-19)
SPECS: Technical SEO pass on staging

  - RankMath/Yoast configured for all pages

  - XML sitemap generated (but NOT submitted — staging)

  - Schema markup implemented on all pages

  - SPEC-006: Schema markup validation

  - SPEC-007: Content quality scoring

  - [All relevant specs applied]

  

  Output: Scorecard per page

    Page: /emergency-plumbing

    Title tag: ✅ PASS (keyword-optimized, 55 chars)

    Meta description: ✅ PASS (compelling, 148 chars)

    H1: ✅ PASS (primary keyword, natural)

    Content depth: ✅ PASS (1,247 words, comprehensive)

    Internal links: ✅ PASS (3 contextual links)

    Schema: ✅ PASS (Service schema, valid)

    Images: ✅ PASS (alt text, compressed, WebP)

    Mobile: ✅ PASS (responsive, touch targets OK)

    Speed: ✅ PASS (LCP 1.8s)

    Overall: 9.2 / 10

  If any page scores below 8.0:

    → Silas generates fix list → routed to Builder or Specs

    → Fix → re-audit → must pass before client review

ARCHER: Only advances to client review when ALL pages 

  score 8.0+ on Silas's audit
Phase 6: Your QC Review (Day 19-20)
ARCHER → YOU (Telegram + Trello):

  "Website build complete for [Client Name].

   Staging URL: [link]

   Silas audit score: 9.1 average

   All pages passed SEO specs.

   Ready for your QC review."

YOU: Visual and functional walkthrough (15-30 min)

  - Does it look professional and polished?

  - Does the design match the client's brand?

  - Any obvious issues a non-technical person would notice?

  - Quick form test (submit one)

  - Quick mobile check (pull up on your phone)

  

  If issues found: Trello card to Builder with notes → fix → done

  If looks good: Approve for client review
Phase 7: Client Review (Day 20-25)
ARCHER → GHL: Trigger client review sequence

  - Send preview link + feedback form (see Part 4)

  - Client has 5 business days

  - Nudge sequence if no response

CLIENT RESPONDS:

Phase 8: Launch (Day 25-28)
TRIGGER: Client approves staging site

PRE-LAUNCH (Builder + Specs):

  1. Domain DNS preparation

     - If new domain: Configure DNS to point to Cloudways

  Option B (DNS cutover from old host):

    - Update DNS A record to Cloudways IP

    - Wait for propagation (can take 24-48 hours)

    - Builder monitors until live

  

  Option C (New domain, no migration):

    - Point domain to Cloudways

    - Activate SSL via Let's Encrypt API

    - Site is live
